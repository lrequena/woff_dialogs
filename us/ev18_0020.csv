ev18_0020_0000;Hey. These tracks don’t go anywhere.
ev18_0020_0001;Maybe they’re doing construction?
ev18_0020_0002;Non non.
ev18_0020_0003;Not [f2]him[/f]...
ev18_0020_0003_02;Yes, me.
ev18_0020_0004;If the conductor is here,[~]then the train must be up and the-running.
ev18_0020_0005;But like, how can he be in so many places?[~]Who’s cactuaring the other trains?
ev18_0020_0006;I’m everywhere my passengers need me![~]The nitty-gritty technical details are a trade secret.
ev18_0020_0007;Ha!
ev18_0020_0008;Nice try!
ev18_0020_0009;D’agh!
ev18_0020_0010;So, uh, Mr. the-Conductor, sir, is the train running?[~]Does it go to the upper the-continent?
ev18_0020_0011;Of course it does! Go on then, all aboard![~]But first... Your tickets, please!
