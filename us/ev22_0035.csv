ev22_0035_0000;Hey, do you mind if I ask you something strange?
ev22_0035_0001;Heh? Like what?
ev22_0035_0002;Am I correct that you’re in charge of controlling the Gates [f2]and[/f] managing our prismariums now?
ev22_0035_0003;What do you mean, “now”? Please. You know full well that this pixie has always been in charge of both.
ev22_0035_0004;I can’t carry the Prism Case everywhere we go, but we can access it from safe locations.
ev22_0035_0005;And you’re the one who returns us to Nine Wood Hills when we fall in battle?
ev22_0035_0006;Heh? Well, yeah, sort of. I have to use the Return Crystal Enna Kros gave me, which unfortunately means we have to come back to Nine Wood Hills every time.
ev22_0035_0007;Hold on a second. This [f2]is[/f] strange. What’s with the sudden barrage of questions?
ev22_0035_0008;Oh! I guess I just...like to go over things now and then.
ev22_0035_0009;Heh? You serious?
ev22_0035_0010;[f2]I guess that means most of what I know about Tama applies to Serafie in this timeline. As long as I remember that, I should be able to play along.[/f]
