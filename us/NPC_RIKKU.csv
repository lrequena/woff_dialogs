npc_rikku_0000_0000;I’ve been to the Babil region loads of times.
npc_rikku_0000_0001;I’ve got things under control.
npc_rikku_0001_0000;I’m a pro when it comes to diving. In fact, I bet I could stay down there all day.
npc_rikku_0001_0001;But, I don’t, since I get really hungry and you can’t sleep down there. Oh well.
npc_rikku_0002_0000;Ooh, I can’t wait to see the amazing places my legs take me today!
npc_rikku_0002_0001;Hi there! Are you two out looking for treasure too?
npc_rikku_0002_0002;Hey I know, why don’t we team up! We could call ourselves...ooh, how about the Gullwings?
