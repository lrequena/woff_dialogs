NAVI_MESSAGE_001;TEST
NAVI_MESSAGE_002;I need to get to North Promenade before I’m late for work.
NAVI_MESSAGE_003;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] There has to be a way out of the woods.
NAVI_MESSAGE_003_2;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Try the-having a look at the Gimme Golem.
NAVI_MESSAGE_004;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Unlock “Stroll” on the chocochick’s the-Mirage Board.
NAVI_MESSAGE_004_1;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Let’s hunt around a little with the chocochick.
NAVI_MESSAGE_004_2;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Now you can the-give the Gimme Golem what it wants.
NAVI_MESSAGE_005;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] What’s waiting for us further ahead?
NAVI_MESSAGE_006;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] I think that stranger the-went to North Promenade.
NAVI_MESSAGE_007;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] We can return to Grymoire through the Main Gate in Sylver Park.
NAVI_MESSAGE_008;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] I hope we’re almost out of the woods.
NAVI_MESSAGE_009;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] What’s over past the bridge? ...A town?
NAVI_MESSAGE_010;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Castle Cornelia is perched up at the top of the town.
NAVI_MESSAGE_011;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Exit Cornelia at the bottom, and then the-north we go!
NAVI_MESSAGE_012;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Princess Sarah said the Nether Nebula is northeast of Cornelia, right?
NAVI_MESSAGE_013;[#ffa7eafc]LANN:[/#] I’m gonna search the caves corner to corner for Mirages!
NAVI_MESSAGE_014;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Why don’t we head back to Cornelia?
NAVI_MESSAGE_015;[#ffa7eafc]LANN:[/#] Operation Lann-Storms-the-Goblin-Camp is [f2]go![/f]
NAVI_MESSAGE_016;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Let’s try and get the drop on the commander from higher up the camp.
NAVI_MESSAGE_017;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Okay, the-back to Castle Cornelia we go.
NAVI_MESSAGE_018;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Cornelia’s northbound train will take us the-toward Saronia.
NAVI_MESSAGE_019;[#ffa7eafc]LANN:[/#] Time to plow through the pretty forest. Who’s with me?
NAVI_MESSAGE_019_1;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Saronia must be across the ice fields.
NAVI_MESSAGE_020;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Can we stop at the inn before my ears the-freeze off?
NAVI_MESSAGE_021;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] There’s a glowing thing that looks like it would warm us up.
NAVI_MESSAGE_022;[#ffa7eafc]REFIA:[/#] Icicle Ridge is due north of the inn.
NAVI_MESSAGE_023;[#ffa7eafc]REFIA:[/#] We need to cross Icicle Ridge to get to Saronia.
NAVI_MESSAGE_024;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] No better way to learn about Saronia than by asking the locals.
NAVI_MESSAGE_025;[#ffa7eafc]LANN:[/#] Let’s go have a word with that Saronian thane guy.
NAVI_MESSAGE_026;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Someone in Saronia must be able to the-point us toward a ship.
NAVI_MESSAGE_027;[#ffa7eafc]LANN:[/#] That pirate ship on the docks sounds promising.
NAVI_MESSAGE_028;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] I think Captain Faris wants a word with us...
NAVI_MESSAGE_029;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Should we tell Quistis we’re ready to go?
NAVI_MESSAGE_029_1;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] This fastcraft will do all the steering the-for us. Yay!
NAVI_MESSAGE_030;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] We should try and get our bearings.
NAVI_MESSAGE_031;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Ask the adamantoise if you the-need a lift.
NAVI_MESSAGE_032;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Yo the-ho! Across the Low Seas we the-go!
NAVI_MESSAGE_033;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] There’s a way off the beach toward the back.
NAVI_MESSAGE_034;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Last one across the cliffs is a rotten the-mandragora!
NAVI_MESSAGE_035;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Wanna visit that town Tifa mentioned? “Nibelheim,” was it?
NAVI_MESSAGE_036;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] That summoner Tifa mentioned the-might be able to help us.
NAVI_MESSAGE_037;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Valley Seven is the-east of Nibelheim.
NAVI_MESSAGE_038;[#ffa7eafc]RYDIA:[/#] Let’s see if these “keys” in the prophecy are real or a hoax.
NAVI_MESSAGE_039;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Rydia needs our help!
NAVI_MESSAGE_040;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Rydia might be able to do something about the wall of fire.
NAVI_MESSAGE_041;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] If we look the-further into Valley Seven, we might find one of the keys.
NAVI_MESSAGE_042;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] I hope we’re not stuck in the muck... Search the area for clues.
NAVI_MESSAGE_043;[#ffa7eafc]LANN:[/#] All I have to do is nab that golden toad...
NAVI_MESSAGE_044;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Hurray! We’re gonna the-help Snow butt-kick the Big Jiggle!
NAVI_MESSAGE_045;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Oh, how I have missed sweet, solid ground. So long, swamp! 
NAVI_MESSAGE_046;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] I say we the-crash over at the caravan.
NAVI_MESSAGE_047;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Maybe we’ll pick up some leads while we rest at the caravan.
NAVI_MESSAGE_047_1;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Seems like north of the caravan is our only choice, so north we go.
NAVI_MESSAGE_048;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] We need to cross the canyons before it gets dark.
NAVI_MESSAGE_049;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] I wonder if Lightning is up for small talk...
NAVI_MESSAGE_050;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Hopefully someone can tell us where we are...
NAVI_MESSAGE_051;[#ffa7eafc]SQUALL:[/#] The clock’s ticking. I’ll brief you on the way down.
NAVI_MESSAGE_052;[#ffa7eafc]LANN:[/#] Now, for the real mission! Reactor, prepare to be rocked.
NAVI_MESSAGE_053;[#ffa7eafc]LANN:[/#] So where’s the “colossal crossing” Edgar mentioned?
NAVI_MESSAGE_053_1;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Next stop, Big Bridge.
NAVI_MESSAGE_053_2;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Everyone the-pile onto the elevator!
NAVI_MESSAGE_054;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] After all that, we have to [f2]walk[/f] up the bridge?
NAVI_MESSAGE_054_1;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] I think this is the home stretch.
NAVI_MESSAGE_055;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] There’s the-bound to be a train at the station.
NAVI_MESSAGE_056;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] That building with the only light in sight is our best bet.
NAVI_MESSAGE_057;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Follow that spiky-haired guy who the-saved our biscuits!
NAVI_MESSAGE_058;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Cloud said he’d take us to the Train Graveyard.
NAVI_MESSAGE_059;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Step the-one: find Vampire Prime. Step the-two: beat up Vampire Prime!
NAVI_MESSAGE_060;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] We should say our good-byes to Celes and Cid.
NAVI_MESSAGE_061;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Start the-craning those necks, because Besaid’s on the continent above Tometown!
NAVI_MESSAGE_062;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] That building north of Tometown... Could it be a...
NAVI_MESSAGE_063;[#ffa7eafc]CONDUCTOR:[/#] All aboard! Zippity-zip!
NAVI_MESSAGE_064;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Let’s ask the people in Besaid about the Sunken Temple.
NAVI_MESSAGE_065;[#ffa7eafc]LANN:[/#] That “pants” person should be able to help us out.
NAVI_MESSAGE_066;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Swimmity-the-swim to the Sunken Temple!
NAVI_MESSAGE_067;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] We need a quacho ruby, but don’t forget we’re after the key too.
NAVI_MESSAGE_068;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] All that’s left is to find the key... Hey, where’d the queen go?
NAVI_MESSAGE_068_1;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] Tidus is the-waiting for us to return with the ruby.
NAVI_MESSAGE_069;[#ffa7eafc]LANN:[/#] That Crystal Tower is just begging to be climbed.
NAVI_MESSAGE_070;[#ffa7eafc]LANN:[/#] We’ve made it this far. Next stop, the tower top!
NAVI_MESSAGE_070_1;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] We the-have to defeat the Mirages guarding the quadrelemence barrier.
NAVI_MESSAGE_070_2;[#ffa7eafc]LANN:[/#] That takes care of the big door, right? Let’s get that sucker open!
NAVI_MESSAGE_070_3;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] ......
NAVI_MESSAGE_071;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] We should compare notes with Quistis.
NAVI_MESSAGE_072;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Tama is in Nine Wood Hills. I hope she’s okay.
NAVI_MESSAGE_073;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] I bet we’ll find Wyn on Balamb Garden’s deck.
NAVI_MESSAGE_074;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] We can use the Girl's Tearoom to help everyone in Grymoire.
NAVI_MESSAGE_074_1;[#ffa7eafc]TAMA:[/#] We need to find the closest the-town with a cathedral.
NAVI_MESSAGE_074_2;[#ffa7eafc]QUISTIS:[/#] That device in the center of the cathedral will take you to the Chainroad.
NAVI_MESSAGE_075;[#ffa7eafc]LANN:[/#] No chain, no gain! Up the Chainroad we go!
NAVI_MESSAGE_076;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] All that’s left is the Heralds’ stronghold... Good luck, everyone.
NAVI_MESSAGE_077;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] First things first: we need to talk to Wyn.
NAVI_MESSAGE_078;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Gathering powerful Mirages and getting stronger! That’s our only hope!
NAVI_MESSAGE_078_1;[#ffa7eafc]REYNN:[/#] Think we’re ready for the final showdown? Then let’s talk to Serafie.
NAVI_MESSAGE_079;[#ffa7eafc]LANN:[/#] Awesome adventures, here we come!
