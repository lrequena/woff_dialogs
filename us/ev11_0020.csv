ev11_0020_0000;Let me introduce the Jiants from the Hills.
ev11_0020_0001;Aha ha ha...heh.
ev11_0020_0002;Yeah, that’s us.
ev11_0020_0003;Hello there. I am the summoner Rydia.
ev11_0020_0004;Hm? Something here is not right.[~]Something about you...
ev11_0020_0005;Hey, you know...the way that Mirage follows you...
ev11_0020_0006;you totally remind me of Yuna![~]I guess it’s because you’re both summoners.
ev11_0020_0007;Huh? You mean you know Lady Yuna?
ev11_0020_0008;Yeah, we met her. Back on the upper continent.[~]She was really a lot of help to us.
ev11_0020_0009;We might not even be the-here[~]if Yuna hadn’t pointed us[~]in the right direction.
ev11_0020_0010;Oh... Well then...[~]I suppose you can’t be [f2]all[/f] that bad.
ev11_0020_0011;There now. You hear that?[~]These two say they’re friends of Lady Yuna.
ev11_0020_0012;That means you can trust them.[~]For the time being, at least.
ev11_0020_0013;So let me get this straight.[~]You’re searching for the four keys recorded in the prophecy?
ev11_0020_0014;Yeah. We came to Babil because we heard[~]one of the keys was hidden here, in a valley of fire.
ev11_0020_0015;Right, but you know,[~]the keys are part of the [f2]Crimson[/f] Prophecy.
ev11_0020_0016;Crimson Prophecy?[~]So wait, you mean there’s more than one version?
ev11_0020_0017;Yes. There used to be a single prophecy:[~]the [f2]Azure[/f] Prophecy.
ev11_0020_0018;It only spoke of four sigils, and said nothing about keys.[~]It was much more abstract.
ev11_0020_0019;The Azure Prophecy is heresy!
ev11_0020_0020;Ugh. This is no business of yours!
ev11_0020_0021;Lies! Only the Crimson Prophecy is gospel!
ev11_0020_0022;Ugh...
ev11_0020_0023;Are you a summoner or not?[~]You should pray that fate guides you to the Crystal Tower.
ev11_0020_0024;The Crimson Prophecy is clear.[~]Flanked by Mirages, the chosen ones shall acquire four keys.
ev11_0020_0025;From the Crystal Tower they shall mount the heavens,[~]where god will grant them the gift of eternity!
ev11_0020_0026;So long as you know to look for the signs,[~]the keys shall be found.
ev11_0020_0027;So do as the Crimson Prophecy commands of you, hmm?
ev11_0020_0028;Ugh. All you hear these days is that nonsense!
ev11_0020_0029;Yeah, no kidding.[~]At least they’re not breaking any laws or getting violent,[~]but it’s still creepy.
ev11_0020_0031;What do those fools know, anyway?[~]The Azure Prophecy was written by the First Summoner!
ev11_0020_0032;It’s the Crimson Prophecy that came later.[~]The whole thing is nothing but a sham.
ev11_0020_0033;Still, that sham seems to be the prophecy folks believe in.
ev11_0020_0034;Unfortunately so.[~]That’s why I came here to sort the truth out myself.
ev11_0020_0035;Tell me, then.[~]Why are you searching for the keys like the prophecy says?
ev11_0020_0036;You see...
ev11_0020_0037;So you’re telling me that your mother shares the same name[~]as Lady Lusse Farna?
ev11_0020_0038;And you’re looking for the Heralds’ castle to find her.
ev11_0020_0039;I get it! If you really are the Jiants from the Hills,[~]all you have to do is follow the prophecy,[~]and you might wind up there anyway.
ev11_0020_0040;Right. There’s actually more to it.
ev11_0020_0041;Someone told us we would find our family[~]as long as we kept collecting Mirages and pressing onward.
ev11_0020_0042;Hmm... Well, whatever the case,[~]it seems the only way to prove which prophecy is true...
ev11_0020_0043;is to accompany the two of you to the valley of fire.
ev11_0020_0044;In a way, you’d be accompanying [f2]me[/f] and doing me a favor.
ev11_0020_0045;What do you mean?
ev11_0020_0046;Oh! Never you mind! So, are we ready?
ev11_0020_0047;Uh, “are we ready”?[~]We don’t even know which valley to go to.
ev11_0020_0048;I’ve already figured it out.[~]The valleys of Babil are numbered,[~]and I believe the one we are looking for is Valley Seven.
