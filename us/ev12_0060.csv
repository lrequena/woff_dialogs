ev12_0060_0000;Ugh... Oh, it’s pointless.[~]None of our attacks seem to do anything!
ev12_0060_0001;Well, look at the bright side.[~]It didn’t fight back very much.
ev12_0060_0002;Well, we beat it but, yeah...[~]I don’t feel like we actually [f2]really[/f] beat it.
ev12_0060_0003;I know. It’s like we’re right back to square one, except...[~]nothing about that thing was square.
ev12_0060_0004;I guess we just didn’t kick it hard enough.
ev12_0060_0005;Snow, what exactly do you have against it again?
ev12_0060_0006;If I don’t keep it in line, it just grows and grows.
ev12_0060_0007;Once, it used to be way, [f2]way[/f] bigger than this.[~]Attacked my village. Did some serious damage.
ev12_0060_0008;I’ve found that a nice, periodic butt-kicking[~]is the best way to keep the Big Jiggle in check.
ev12_0060_0009;Sounds like a big, big, BIG nuisance to me.
ev12_0060_0010;Well, thanks to you, I was able to smack it around[~]a lot more than usual today.
ev12_0060_0011;It won’t be attacking towns for a while.
ev12_0060_0012;Anyway... It looks like the swamp up ahead[~]should be nice and dry now.
ev12_0060_0013;I think you’re good to walk.
ev12_0060_0014;Okay...
ev12_0060_0015;Maybe I’ll see you all again sometime!
ev12_0060_0016;You know, even for a guy who slings around ice magic,[~]he was surprisingly chill.
ev12_0060_0017;Yeah, I’ll say.[~]So, you ready to kiss this place good-bye?
ev12_0060_0018;I hope that the rest is the-easy going.
ev12_0060_0019;Yeah, Tama, me too.
