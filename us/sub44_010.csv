sub44_010_0000;......
sub44_010_0001;Is there something wrong, Quistis?
sub44_010_0002;Oh, I just wish I was less busy.[~]I hardly have any time to keep exploring the Garden...
sub44_010_0003;Well, there’s not much you can do.[~]Still, remember when we moved SeeD here? Feels like ages ago.
sub44_010_0004;Yeah. We were conducting an airship test flight in the area[~]when boom, there the Garden was.
sub44_010_0005;It was crawling with Mirages.
sub44_010_0006;But, it was worth it for the technology and magic alone.[~]The stuff here is way beyond what we had at the time.
sub44_010_0007;A brand-new airship engine... This gunblade... The draw tech...
sub44_010_0008;Yeah, but, we should have been more careful.[~]The machines went berserk after we gave them to Shinra.
sub44_010_0009;In retrospect, isn’t it possible they were connected to the Cogna?[~]We should have done our homework better before handing over our findings.
sub44_010_0010;Hm? So you’re saying that the Garden is tied to the Cogna somehow?[~]Isn’t that kind of a stretch?
sub44_010_0011;I see. You never [f2]did[/f] give Reynn and Lann full access here.[~]Now I know why.
sub44_010_0012;Just so you know,[~]they still think it’s because you don’t trust them.
sub44_010_0013;What do you want me to do?[~]If the Garden really is some kind of Cogna haven—
sub44_010_0014;Oh, don’t worry. Our friend here isn’t like that.
sub44_010_0015;Eiko? Hm? Wait, what do you mean, “our friend”?[~]Do you know something about the Garden?
sub44_010_0016;Well, it’s really more of a feeling...[~]You know Big Bridge? I think the Garden here is very much like him.
sub44_010_0017;Huh? So...
sub44_010_0018;Right. Maybe Balamb Garden...is just one big Mirage.
sub44_010_0019;Although... When I reach out to touch its mind,[~]it doesn’t respond to me in the slightest.
sub44_010_0020;It must be sleeping—[~]way, [f2]way[/f] more soundly than I have ever seen with Big Bridge.
sub44_010_0021;Shall I try...waking it up?
sub44_010_0022;Uh... Is that a good idea?
sub44_010_0023;I don’t think that it means us any harm.[~]But, if things [f2]do[/f] get out of hand...
sub44_010_0024;Got it. We’ll deal with whatever comes up.
sub44_010_0025;Ugh... I guess so.
sub44_010_0026;Why thank you.
sub44_010_0027;Hey. Think you could wake up so we can talk?[~]Can I ask what your name is?
sub44_010_0028;Eden... Eden of Balamb.
sub44_010_0029;Eden...
sub44_010_0030;Oh no. So it [f2]is[/f] connected to the Cogna?
sub44_010_0031;No. Eden’s saying that waking it up[~]opened some kind of pathway to...another world.
sub44_010_0032;Usually, it chooses to stay in a deep sleep in order to keep the path closed.[~]That’s the only way this world will stay safe.
sub44_010_0033;Either way, we need to send ’em back!
