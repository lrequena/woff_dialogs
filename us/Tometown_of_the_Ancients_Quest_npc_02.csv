Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_02_A_01;Hey, you there! Do you have a minute? I’ve got a little request.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_02_A_02;See, there’s been a Mirage infestation in the Train Graveyard.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_02_A_03;Is there any chance you could take care of them before they set their sights on our town?
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_02_B_01;You’ll do it? Oh wow, thank you!
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_02_B_02;All you have to do is head to the Train Graveyard and take out a few Mirages. Thanks! We’re counting on you!
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_02_C;No can do, huh? Ah, it’s a lot to ask, I know. Hey, forget I said anything. We’ll do what we can to deal with it ourselves.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_02_D;Have you changed your mind about helping us?
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_02_E;Head over to the Train Graveyard and take out as many Mirages as you can find. Don’t worry about getting all of ’em.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_02_F_01;You thinned them out? Oh, you’re the best!
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_02_F_02;Now the Train Graveyard should be back to its old self. Thanks! This is for you.
