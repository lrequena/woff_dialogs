ev14_0020_0000;Excuse me. Do you know where we are?
ev14_0020_0001;Huh? Jiants, eh? Heh.[~]Now what did you do to get thrown into [f2]this[/f] sorry place?
ev14_0020_0002;Huh?
ev14_0020_0003;This is a prison, situated beneath Figaro Castle.
ev14_0020_0004;Dude, [f2]prison?[/f] For real?
ev14_0020_0005;Well, they call it prison,[~]but it’s more like a death sentence.
ev14_0020_0006;That can’t be! There [f2]must[/f] be a way out of here!
ev14_0020_0007;Oh, wouldn’t that be nice?[~]But you can forget about it.
ev14_0020_0008;You won’t find any human guards, ’cause much worse is on patrol:[~]sentient machines that hunt down all who try to escape.
ev14_0020_0009;Just surviving down here is a small miracle.
ev14_0020_0010;Sentient machines?
ev14_0020_0011;They’re not Mirages?
ev14_0020_0012;How’s a lowly prisoner like me to know?[~]But I suppose that they must not be.
ev14_0020_0013;When the king of Figaro stumbled upon this place some years ago,[~]he decided to enlist help from folks at Shinra.
ev14_0020_0014;But then, all the machines that Shinra brought in—[~]they started attacking people, as if they had minds of their own.
ev14_0020_0015;Ultimately, the site was abandoned,[~]and now the worst of Figaro’s criminals are sent here to rot.
