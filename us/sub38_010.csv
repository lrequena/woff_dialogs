sub38_010_0000;Whew... Home at last.
sub38_010_0001;I never thought I’d run into my master,[~]let alone get subjected to so much rigorous training.
sub38_010_0002;Huh? What’s going on?
sub38_010_0003;You remember the flood.[~]That was the very first sign of the punishment to come!
sub38_010_0004;The appearance of those mechanical monsters and horrible Mirages—[~]this is all the wrath of the Crimson Prophecy!
sub38_010_0005;And who do we have to blame for it but that heretic.[~]She came here spouting the Azure Prophecy’s lies...
sub38_010_0006;and now it is [f2]we[/f] who are being punished for it!
sub38_010_0007;She called herself a summoner,[~]but her foolishness and blasphemy have cost us dear, you mark my—
sub38_010_0008;How can you say that?![~]You can’t possibly blame others for this!
sub38_010_0009;Oh, please! There’s no mistaking it.[~]The unbelievers have brought this upon themselves.
sub38_010_0010;Gimme a break. [~]If the Crimson Prophecy [f2]did[/f] turn the world upside down, there you go.[~]What better reason [f2]not[/f] to go along with it?
sub38_010_0011;What did you say?![~]How dare you ridicule the one true—
sub38_010_0012;GRRRAAAH!
sub38_010_0013;Aaah! What kind of Mirage is that?!
sub38_010_0014;Wh-wh-where did it come from?![~]S-s-somebody send for help!
sub38_010_0015;Oh, pull it together![~]I’ll take care of this.
sub38_010_0016;Haaah!
sub38_010_0017;It...didn’t work?
sub38_010_0018;GRRRAAAH!
sub38_010_0019;Aaah!
sub38_010_0020;Can’t you see this is all your fault?![~]It’s here because of you!
sub38_010_0021;You see what happens when you side with heretics?![~]The prophecy is going to see that we all pay!
sub38_010_0022;Oh, for the...
sub38_010_0023;Fine. What’re you planning to do about it?
sub38_010_0024;What?
sub38_010_0025;Listen to you. All this talk of prophecies and punishment...[~]Where is that going to get you?
sub38_010_0026;You want to blame others for the machines?[~]You want to blame others for this Mirage? That’s fine.
sub38_010_0027;And then? What next?
sub38_010_0028;Go ahead and believe in any prophecy you want,[~]but you better like what it gives you if you’re not going to act!
sub38_010_0029;So? What's [f2]your [/f]brilliant plan of action then?!
sub38_010_0030;Yeah! We saw it.[~]You weren’t able to put so much as a scratch on that thing!
sub38_010_0031;Only those who believe in the prophecy shall be rewarded!
sub38_010_0032;There will always be times when even your best efforts fail.[~]But the courage to give it another go...that’s the steel you forge destinies with.
sub38_010_0033;Have it your way.[~]Go ahead and hold out hope for some miracle,[~]and let that Mirage stomp all over you.
sub38_010_0034;But I’m not giving up. I’m defending this town...[~]if the power’s in my hands!
sub38_010_0035;Final Heaven!
sub38_010_0036;Wha—?!
sub38_010_0037;Yes! Let’s go!
