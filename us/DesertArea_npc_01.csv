DesertArea_npc_01_A_01;Whoa there, whoa! Tell me you’re not going out there dressed like that!
DesertArea_npc_01_A_02;You’ll get baked to a crisp if you don’t take the proper precautions.
DesertArea_npc_01_A_03;There’s a caravan not too far from here. I suggest you stop by and prepare for the journey ahead.
DesertArea_npc_01_B_01;That merchant fraud... I made sure every traveler trying to pass through here dropped by his caravan, [f2]just[/f] like he asked.
DesertArea_npc_01_B_02;But then he ran off without paying me the finder’s fee he promised!
DesertArea_npc_01_B_03;Hmm, maybe I dodged a bullet. That creep was always mumbling to himself—something about a suppressant he was adding to his sunscreen to keep people’s powers in check.
DesertArea_npc_01_B_03_1;Well, whatever his deal was, good riddance!
DesertArea_npc_01_C;Always go in prepared!
