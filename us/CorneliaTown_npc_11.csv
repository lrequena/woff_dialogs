Cornelia_npc_11_A_01;So the Jiants from the Hills weren’t just a legend after all! Whoazers! That would mean, according to the prophecy...
Cornelia_npc_11_A_02;Eh, who cares about prophecies? The important thing is: whoazers!
Cornelia_npc_11_B;I can’t believe you chased off the Bahamutian Army! Oh, the Jiants from the Hills sure are something!
Cornelia_npc_11_C;Do you think...maybe this is what the prophecy meant by “ruin”?
Cornelia_npc_11_D_01;I’m not sure I fully understand what’s going on, but...if those strange Mirages are really gone for good...
Cornelia_npc_11_D_02;Do you think this could be what the prophecy meant by “salvation”?
Cornelia_npc_11_D_03;Well, whatever the case, at least things are nice and peaceful now! This is great! Everything’s coming up whoazers!
