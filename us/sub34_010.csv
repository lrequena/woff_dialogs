sub34_010_0002;Stay awaaaaaay!
sub34_010_0003;......
sub34_010_0004;Just leave me alooone!
sub34_010_0005;I thought so.[~]Rydia, what are you doing?
sub34_010_0006;Ah! ...Oh! Lady Yuna.
sub34_010_0007;Ohhh. Now I understand.[~]So you came here to train and try to conquer your fears. That’s great!
sub34_010_0008;How do I put this...? The others are doing so much.[~]I don’t want to keep getting in their way all the time.
sub34_010_0009;Well, why don’t I help you out?[~]If that’s all right.
sub34_010_0010;Huh? Oh, no! Not when you are so busy, my lady.
sub34_010_0011;But you’re doing something important that I want to be a part of.[~]Please, let me help out.
sub34_010_0012;You and I are summoners.[~]We should stick together.
sub34_010_0013;Oh, Lady Yuna... You’re too kind.
sub34_010_0014;So, you say there’s an adversary here[~]that represents all of your fears?
sub34_010_0015;Not long ago, I started sensing a powerful fire entity here.[~]Even the other Mirages seem intent on keeping a healthy distance.
sub34_010_0016;You’re right. I can feel its presence.[~]Rydia, will you be okay?
sub34_010_0017;Yes. If I’m going to overcome my fears for good,[~]I need to go up against the fiercest flames I can find!
sub34_010_0018;All right then. Here we go, Rydia.
