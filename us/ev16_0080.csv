ev16_0080_0000;Thank you for the demonstration.
ev16_0080_0001;Yeah, thanks!
ev16_0080_0002;Hey, no sweat! I’m Bartz.[~]And this is my partner, Boko.
ev16_0080_0003;Kweh!
ev16_0080_0004;Oh, hey—
ev16_0080_0005;I’ve heard there’s some weirdo going around here,[~]yelling my name and attacking total strangers...
ev16_0080_0006;W-wait, wait.[~]It’s not one of [f2]you,[/f] is it?
ev16_0080_0007;Huh?
ev16_0080_0008;No. We didn’t even [f2]know[/f][~]your name until you just told us.
ev16_0080_0009;Oh good. Well, I’d better keep looking for him.[~]Can’t have folks like that roaming around.
ev16_0080_0010;If some bully was going the-round using [f2]my[/f] name[~]to hurt a bunch of innocent people, I’d be the-weirded out too.
ev16_0080_0011;I know, right?
ev16_0080_0012;Heh! Maybe if Tama was a “tama-[f2]hawk[/f],”[~]then her name could—
ev16_0080_0013;Awful! Your grade for that one is the-“PU.”
ev16_0080_0014;Yeah, that [f2]did[/f] stink.
ev16_0080_0015;“PU”? But that’s [f2]two[/f] grades!
