MoveDesertCastle_Quest_npc_01_A_01;Ugh, what a pain... Huh? Say, you wouldn’t happen to be the Jiants from the Hills, would you?
MoveDesertCastle_Quest_npc_01_A_02;Wow, perfect timing! You see, there’s a little favor I’d like to ask of you...
MoveDesertCastle_Quest_npc_01_A_03;Recently, the sand worms out in the Phantom Sands have been getting more aggressive, and have started causing trouble for the merchants that pass nearby.
MoveDesertCastle_Quest_npc_01_A_04;Normally it’s my job to go out there and deal with them, but as luck would have it, I did a number on my arm yesterday.
MoveDesertCastle_Quest_npc_01_A_05;Could you go there in my stead and stomp out that nest of wriggly invertebrates?
MoveDesertCastle_Quest_npc_01_B;Good luck out there!
MoveDesertCastle_Quest_npc_01_C_01;Hey, you’re back! Thanks for doing my job for me... I mean, boy, does my arm hurt like the dickens!
MoveDesertCastle_Quest_npc_01_C_02;You really helped me out! Here, this is for you!
MoveDesertCastle_Quest_npc_01_D;Ehh... Man, I don’t want to work...
