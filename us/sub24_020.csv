sub24_020_0000;His magic is unbelievably strong. But, it’s strange...[~]There’s something about him that feels so familiar...
sub24_020_0001;Hey. Is there a reason you called out to us like that?
sub24_020_0002;Huh? What?
sub24_020_0003;Eiko. We are so proud of you. Still so young, and yet[~]you have carried the tribe’s heavy burden with head held high. Thank you.
sub24_020_0004;Is that the Mirage talking?[~]Wait... I know this voice...
sub24_020_0005;Eiko. These are dark times.[~]And Grymoire faces a terrible crisis.
sub24_020_0006;The world will soon have need of the power our tribe possesses,[~]and the Mirages who answer our call.
sub24_020_0007;“The Mirages who answer our call”?[~]What do you mean? Are there others out there besides Fenrir?
sub24_020_0008;You share a connection with many Mirages. You must find them.[~]Join their power with yours, and wield it well.[~]The future is yours... May it be bright...
sub24_020_0009;Ah... Wait!
sub24_020_0010;You are not alone, Eiko.[~]The tribe will always be watching over you.
sub24_020_0011;Awoo...
sub24_020_0012;Fenrir...
sub24_020_0013;Know who that was?[~]That had to have been one of my ancestors’ Mirages.
sub24_020_0014;Come to think of it, Grandfather once told me...[~]after I celebrate my sixteenth birthday,[~]I would be able to form bonds with many different Mirages.
sub24_020_0015;But now, I need to focus on the things I can accomplish in the present.[~]After all, I’ve still got a long, long way to grow!
sub24_020_0016;Fenrir, can I count on you to be there for me?
sub24_020_0017;Arf!
sub24_020_0018;Grymoire’s in danger...
sub24_020_0019;And if it needs my tribe’s power—the summoners’ power—[~]then I’ll share it with you. Reynn, Lann.
