sub25_030_0000;Oh! Hello again. What’s up?
sub25_030_0001;Well, that’s creepy.[~]You’re here about the black fox?
sub25_030_0002;Wait, what do you mean?
sub25_030_0003;......
sub25_030_0004;I knew the woman who was killed.[~]She was...my aunt.
sub25_030_0005;Huh?
sub25_030_0006;What?
sub25_030_0007;Heh? Wait, if she’s your aunt, she’s gotta be...[~]She [f2]has[/f] to be...
sub25_030_0008;Yes. That’s correct. She was Uncle Takka—[~]I mean, the thane of Saronia’s wife.
sub25_030_0009;Hang on.[~]If that’s a coincidence, it really [f2]is[/f] creepy.
sub25_030_0010;Tell me, why do you need to find that black fox?
sub25_030_0011;You want it to share its lives?[~]Well, good luck with that.
sub25_030_0012;I figured. Not the sharing type.
sub25_030_0013;It doesn’t matter.[~]We should still try to get our hands on its prismarium.
sub25_030_0014;Then why not let me help you out?[~]I can take you to where the fox is.
sub25_030_0015;Refia, are you sure?
sub25_030_0016;Yes, I’ll be fine.[~]And Reynn and Lann will be there.
sub25_030_0017;Whoa whoa! Let’s not forget [f2]I’m[/f] going too.
sub25_030_0018;Oh, of course. Goes without saying.
sub25_030_0019;Mmm-hmm. That’s more like it.
sub25_030_0020;Okay.[~]Well, you be careful out there.
sub25_030_0021;Mm.
sub25_030_0022;Oh, and you don’t have to turn into a cat[~]and follow us this time.
sub25_030_0023;I know, I know.[~]Just get going.
