ev01_0100_0000;Ow!
ev01_0100_0001;Waaah! Show the-yourself, Serafie![~]I the-know it was you!
ev01_0100_0002;Well, you had it coming.
ev01_0100_0003;You know when you awakened, you should’ve woke me up too.[~]I don’t remember raising you to be such a selfish selfer-poop.
ev01_0100_0004;Well, I don’t remember you the-raising me at all!
ev01_0100_0005;Who’s this?
ev01_0100_0006;Oh, hi. I’m just your adorable local wind pixie,[~]aka Serafie.
ev01_0100_0007;My hobbies include gossipmongering and, uh, let’s see...[~]Oh, I’m good at hoarding things. Yup.
ev01_0100_0008;Hoarding?
ev01_0100_0009;Hoarding. Why do you think I’m here?
ev01_0100_0010;You must have tons of prismariums.[~]More than you can handle, right?
ev01_0100_0011;Well...we’re still working on it.
ev01_0100_0012;Uh-huh. You’ll have scads of them before long.[~]You’re gonna need a place to unload.
ev01_0100_0013;Yeah, they are kind of bulky.
ev01_0100_0014;Well, who’s got you covered?[~]This pixie right here.
ev01_0100_0015;Enna Kros made me a special Prism Case[~]that lets me keep all your prismariums safe.
ev01_0100_0016;Just plonk the ones you [f2]don’t[/f] need in[~]and yoink the ones you [f2]do[/f] need out.
ev01_0100_0017;All plonking and yoinking must be performed within the confines of[~]Nine Wood Hills or from an alternate location with a suitably strong[~]connection. Additional terms, conditions, and restrictions may apply.
ev01_0100_0018;NOT USED
ev01_0100_0019;Oh...kay.
ev01_0100_0020;I’m not sure I caught every single word,[~]but I guess...“I Agree”?
ev01_0100_0021;Oh yeah. This prismarium belongs to one of my tribe.[~]Treat it with the same boundless love and affection you feel for me.
ev01_0100_0022;Oh...kay.
ev01_0100_0023;Serafie’s kind of a “special” the-case.
ev01_0100_0024;Obtained a [#ffffff73]sylph prismarium[/#].
ev01_0100_0025;The Prism Case is used to store the[~]{NewLine}prismariums you obtain.
ev01_0100_0026;Any prismariums you obtain are automatically[~]{NewLine}stored in the Prism Case. You can swap prismariums[~]{NewLine}in and out in town and in the field.
ev01_0100_0027;However, you can’t change your prismariums while[~]{NewLine}in dungeons or dangerous areas, so choose wisely[~]{NewLine}before rushing in.
