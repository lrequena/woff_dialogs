ev22_0090_0000;All right!
ev22_0090_0001;We won?
ev22_0090_0002;No... Not yet...
ev22_0090_0003;Fools. I have hunted the worlds of A for ages![~]But yours was the very first in which I made true progress.
ev22_0090_0004;Which means, I can now bring my rules into your world.[~]And I happen to be exceedingly fond of my rules...
ev22_0090_0005;Observe!
ev22_0090_0006;Do you see! I have infinite life, and power beyond all limits![~]There is no force that can stand before me!
ev22_0090_0007;Not even the Champions of this A-World can vanquish me.
ev22_0090_0008;So! Your choice. Will you bow before my rules?[~]Or will I watch you snap, as the rules of my world break you!
