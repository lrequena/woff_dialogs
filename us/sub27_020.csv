sub27_020_0002;My time has come! I shall [f2]rule[/f] on high![~]Now, no Mirage can stand in my way!

sub27_020_0005;Sure can.[~]You must have sensed them there, by your side?
sub27_020_0006;Hmm... I don’t know what’s going on,[~]but the important thing here...is that I won.
sub27_020_0007;Right! Now that my prismarium has gotten just a little more robust-y,[~]I expect to do great things! Lann. Reynn.
