sub21_010_0000;Chocolatte, come quick!
sub21_010_0001;Oh! Well, hello there, Bartz.[~]What’s the matter?
sub21_010_0002;It’s Boko! He’s been choco-napped![~]It’s gotta be Hyperion! He and his gang are up to no good again.
sub21_010_0003;What?!
sub21_010_0004;So Boko’s here, huh? That’s amazing, Chocolatte.[~]I don’t know anyone else who can pick up a chocobo SOS.
sub21_010_0005;Oh, yes, well... So tell me![~]How was Boko choco-napped again?
sub21_010_0006;Well, ya see, I was kind of taking a nap,[~]so I’m not entirely sure how it all went down.
sub21_010_0007;But suddenly, I could hear Boko kwehing.[~]He sounded unmistakably hostile, just like when we faced that black chocobo.
sub21_010_0008;Wow. But I’m quite certain I would have sensed it if Hyperion was still around.[~]Which can only mean it must have been something else...
sub21_010_0010;Master, what is it?[~]...Huh?!
sub21_010_0011;Bartz, Boko’s in big trouble![~]We have to go in now!
sub21_010_0012;Huh? What?! Chocolatte, how do you know that he—[~]Hey! Wait up!
sub21_010_0013;Boko!
sub21_010_0015;Kweeeh...
sub21_010_0016;What in the...
sub21_010_0017;Oh! Master!
sub21_010_0018;Hmph. So you’re this specimen’s owner. It’s about time.
sub21_010_0019;What the?! This chocobo can talk?!
sub21_010_0020;Huh? What’re you talkin’ about?
sub21_010_0021;Choco-boco-leeen—agh, no.[~]Don’t you see, Bartz? It’s being translated by—
sub21_010_0022;Huh? Hey, just hold on a sec.[~]Isn’t that the same chick that was sitting on your head?
sub21_010_0023;Whoa! That thing was alive?!
sub21_010_0024;Hey, pay attention.
sub21_010_0025;Uh, yes, well... You [f2]could[/f] say it’s alive, buuut...[~]It’s more like I live [f2]with[/f] it, so...
sub21_010_0026;Stop runnin’ yer traps, I’m tryin’ to talk over here!
sub21_010_0027;Hmm. This chocobo seems to be pretty intelligent.
sub21_010_0028;Makes you wonder why he bothers carin’ so much about his human owner.[~]He oughta be completely ashamed of himself.
sub21_010_0029;And I had such hopes that he’d be a prime specimen[~]when we mecha chocobos populate this world.
sub21_010_0030;Wait, hold on, mecha chocobos?[~]Populate this world?
sub21_010_0031;For far too long now, this world’s chocobos have nuzzled up to you humans.[~]Isn’t that the most ridiculous thing you’ve ever heard?
sub21_010_0032;Isn’t that normal? Humans and chocobos are—[~]I mean, take me and Boko. We’ve always survived by helping each other out.
sub21_010_0033;Hmph. What you call “helping each other” I call “subjugation.”[~]Everyone knows chocobos are smarter than humans.
sub21_010_0034;It’s time for Grymoire’s chocobos to welcome the Cogna[~]and become this world’s dominant species!
sub21_010_0035;What are you talking about?![~]Boko would never want something like that!
sub21_010_0036;That’s right![~]And the same is true for all the chocobos out there!
sub21_010_0037;Huh? Who are you? Hmm... How very unusual.[~]Why would you go and lower yourself by siding with this human?
sub21_010_0038;Me? I’m not lowering anything![~]The chocobos of this world are already perfectly happy without your help.
sub21_010_0039;You think being enslaved by humans...is happiness?[~]What a heaping load of phoenix down.
sub21_010_0040;I’ve heard enough. Boko here is comin’ along with us.[~]You made a big mistake spyin’ on us![~]Now you’re gonna pay the ultimate price!
sub21_010_0041;It’s not spying when you go and blab it all over the place!
