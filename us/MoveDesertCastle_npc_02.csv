MoveDesertCastle_npc_02_A_01;Oh, hello! Are you here to see King Edgar?
MoveDesertCastle_npc_02_A_02;Feel free to take it easy. After all, you two are this castle’s liberators!
MoveDesertCastle_npc_02_B_01;We’re not so pathetic that we’d lose to a bunch of dingy machines.
MoveDesertCastle_npc_02_B_02;You two hang in there, too. Good luck.
MoveDesertCastle_npc_02_C_01;Hey there! Are you here to see King Edgar, too?
MoveDesertCastle_npc_02_C_02;Now that things have settled down around here, women from all across the world that King Edgar has befriended have been coming to visit almost every day.
MoveDesertCastle_npc_02_C_03;I still don’t know how he found the time to go out and meet ’em all...but, I guess it’s just another sign that peace has returned. Heh heh heh!
