ev19_0060_0000;Rrrggghhh!
ev19_0060_0001;Cut me some slack, door!
ev19_0060_0002;Do you really think talking to it is gonna help?
ev19_0060_0003;Maybe all this time,[~]it wanted the-someone to “open up” to!
ev19_0060_0004;Oh, c’mon. I mean, anything is possible.[~]After all the weird stuff we’ve seen happen—
ev19_0060_0005;Not the-possible.
ev19_0060_0006;And also dumb?
ev19_0060_0007;Dude, what?
ev19_0060_0008;But, I can always just add this one to the pile.
ev19_0060_0009;Another “Lann moment”?[~]So how many am I up to now?
ev19_0060_0010;These symbols seem to be earth, water, fire, and wind.[~]It’s the four elements.
ev19_0060_0011;That’s the-right![~]You the-know your stuff.
ev19_0060_0012;Our mom taught us about them when we were—
ev19_0060_0013;Reynn, you remember?
ev19_0060_0014;Huh? No, I just...[~]Where did [f2]that[/f] come from?
ev19_0060_0015;Maybe you’ve been the-here,[~]or it could be your mother is somewhere close the-by.
ev19_0060_0016;Really?
ev19_0060_0017;Hey. I said the-[f2]maybe[/f].
ev19_0060_0018;O-oh...[~]Well, yeah. Of course.
ev19_0060_0019;Uh... So what’s up with the four symbols?
ev19_0060_0020;They’re probably the-tied to what we call a quadrelemence barrier.[~]Each element is defended by its own the-separate Mirage.
ev19_0060_0021;In other words,[~]we’re dealing with at least four different Mirages.
ev19_0060_0022;You the-got it.
ev19_0060_0023;All right, then. Let’s track ’em down and—[~]Hey, Reynn, what’s wrong?
ev19_0060_0024;Huh? Yeah, we need to find the Mirages[~]guarding the four elemental locks.
ev19_0060_0025;She wasn’t even paying attention[~]and still summarized it better than me.
ev19_0060_0026;You do kind of have a habit[~]of branching the-off on tangents.
ev19_0060_0027;Yup. Those Lann moments are really piling up. Shall we?
ev19_0060_0028;Let’s shall.[~]You know, I want to inspect this pile.
ev19_0060_0029;Oh, don’t even the-bother![~]It’s so the-deep, you’d the-never be able to see it all.
ev19_0060_0030;Hang on. Piles aren’t deep, they’re tall right?
ev19_0060_0031;Well if you ask the-me, it’s all a matter of perspective. What if you’re the-sitting up on the top of the pile? Maybe you’re the-looking at it the wrong way.
ev19_0060_0033;Dude!
ev19_0060_0034;[f2]This place. I know I remember it.[~]But, when could I have possibly come here?[/f]
