ev02_0060_0000;Jiants...
ev02_0060_0001;Oh! Whoops...
ev02_0060_0002;Are they Bahamutian soldiers?
ev02_0060_0003;But they drove the Mirages off for us.
ev02_0060_0004;It’s just like the prophecy, word for word!
ev02_0060_0005;But...which one?
ev02_0060_0006;Well, we [f2]know[/f] how it ends...
ev02_0060_0007;Please. May I speak with you?
ev02_0060_0008;Huh?
ev02_0060_0009;Oh, sure.
ev02_0060_0010;The two of you—[~]you’ve traveled here from another world.
ev02_0060_0011;Oh, well... I wouldn’t... I mean...
ev02_0060_0012;Actually, I think you’re pretty much spot on.[~]And we’re Mirage Keepers, too!
ev02_0060_0013;But— Lann, don’t tell her!
ev02_0060_0014;Why not? Face it, we’re too awesome[~]to try and hide it.
ev02_0060_0015;I’m like...exuding all over.
ev02_0060_0016;Lann, you don’t even know what “exude” means.
ev02_0060_0017;There is...someone who would like to have a word with you.[~]Could you possibly stop by Castle Cornelia?
