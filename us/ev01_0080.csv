ev01_0080_0000;Durff!
ev01_0080_0001;Agh!
ev01_0080_0002;Unnh... Ooh ooh ooh ow.
ev01_0080_0003;Oh no! Did you two die already?
ev01_0080_0004;What?! I died? But that’s... No way.
ev01_0080_0005;Maybe it’s true...[~]That Mirage in the murkrift did kinda...
ev01_0080_0006;Well, [f2]I’m[/f] still alive.
ev01_0080_0007;Yes. That’s because someone intervened[~]right at the moment of your demise,[~]and made it so the battle never happened.
ev01_0080_0008;NOT USED
ev01_0080_0009;Wow, you can really do that?
ev01_0080_0010;Of course! Although Tama’s the one who does it.
ev01_0080_0011;That’s the-right![~]I have the power to rewind time a little,[~]and then the-whisk you to safety.
ev01_0080_0012;Although, it the-costs me a life to do it,[~]so I hope you don’t mind if I rest[~]for a little the-while afterwards.
ev01_0080_0013;A “life”?
ev01_0080_0014;You might not the-believe it, but I’ve actually[~]got multiple lives. Back there, I had to sacrifice[~]one of those lives to turn back time and the-save you.
ev01_0080_0015;You see, this girl with a ribbon[~]the-showed up in my dreams.[~]She’s the one who taught me how to the-do it.
ev01_0080_0016;That makes zero sense[~]and kind of freaks me out,[~]but Tama, I’m [f2]impressed![/f]
ev01_0080_0017;The-thanks!
ev01_0080_0018;Oh! But just so you know, I can only the-use my powers[~]to protect the two of you specifically.
ev01_0080_0019;And only the-if you lose a fight,[~]like what happened to you in the murkrift.
ev01_0080_0020;Oh the-yeah! And I can always the-recover my lives[~]if you stay here and let me the-rest a spell.
ev01_0080_0021;So don’t forget to give me a breather[~]before I run out of second the-chances.
ev01_0080_0022;Dude! You got it.[~]Say no more! Rest yourself silly.
ev01_0080_0023;Yes the-sir!
ev01_0080_0024;Thanks, Tama. We really owe you one.
ev01_0080_0025;Especially Lann,[~]who didn’t have the good sense[~]to [f2]listen[/f] before diving in.
ev01_0080_0026;Er, ah... Heh heh.
ev01_0080_0027;Hey. Who’s that?
ev01_0080_0028;Oh! If you mean our new guest,[~]she claims to have gotten herself lost.
ev01_0080_0029;Go say hello! She’s quite the character.
ev01_0080_0030;Uh, okay!
ev01_0080_0031;The real question is how she got here[~]from the outside world when it’s no easy trick.
ev01_0080_0032;She must have experience crossing between planes.
ev01_0080_0033;Huh? Where’d she go?
ev01_0080_0034;She headed for that building the-over there.
ev01_0080_0035;Oh! That’s over by where I work!
ev01_0080_0036;Hey, would you both slow down?
