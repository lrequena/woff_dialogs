ev21_0040_0000;Huh? Does Quistis want something?
ev21_0040_0001;Ah, there you are.[~]Just so you know, a message is waiting for you at the airship.
ev21_0040_0002;Do you have a moment?
ev21_0040_0003;Sure. What’s up?
ev21_0040_0004;We’ve located the king of Bahamut and his lieutenants.
ev21_0040_0005;Dude, really?!
ev21_0040_0006;Really, dude.
ev21_0040_0007;Where are they?
ev21_0040_0008;The end of the chains.
ev21_0040_0009;Uh... What now?
ev21_0040_0010;You already know the towns under Federation control[~]are anchored to chains that extend into the sky.
ev21_0040_0011;Guh! Don’t tell me.
ev21_0040_0012;Oh, I’m tellin’ ya. We know now that all of those anchors[~]were fired from the same exact location.
ev21_0040_0013;And that spot must be Bahamut’s seat of power.
ev21_0040_0014;So you’re saying their castle—it just floats there?
ev21_0040_0015;Apparently. If Balamb Garden can do it,[~]then why not the Federation?
ev21_0040_0016;Great! Then we can just sail the-up there in our airship!
ev21_0040_0017;Not quite.
ev21_0040_0018;Here’s the problem. Their castle sits at a much higher altitude.[~]The airship simply isn’t built to travel that high.
ev21_0040_0019;Oh, come on. Then what do we do?!
ev21_0040_0020;First, you should visit a cathedral.
ev21_0040_0021;A cathedral?
ev21_0040_0022;Yes. At the heart of every town that’s a part of the Federation,[~]you’re certain to find one.
ev21_0040_0023;They’re sanctuaries that only admit people chosen as Architects.[~]And they’re much more than that. You need to see it.
ev21_0040_0024;Once you have,[~]then I’ll explain how to get to the castle.
