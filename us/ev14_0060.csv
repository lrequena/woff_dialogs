ev14_0060_0000;Me, I’m with SeeD, a mercenary group in the League of S. We fight against the Federation.
ev14_0060_0001;I know who you are. Quistis filled me in.
ev14_0060_0002;Quistis...was... Oh! She gave us the fastcraft!
ev14_0060_0003;Ohhh, so she’s in the League of S! The lass in glasses.
ev14_0060_0004;Heh. That’s right. She’s an officer, in fact.
ev14_0060_0005;Wow! I didn’t know she was a big shot.
ev14_0060_0006;So why are you here helping us out like this? I don’t suppose it’s to...make up for the waterfall.
ev14_0060_0007;Hm? Sorry, but I don’t think she ever mentioned a waterfall.
ev14_0060_0008;It was Edgar, the guy who put you in here, that asked me to help you out.
ev14_0060_0009;What? That creep? Why?
ev14_0060_0010;You’ve seen the anchor that’s latched on to the desert castle. Edgar’s kingdom?
ev14_0060_0011;Yeah?
ev14_0060_0012;In order to break loose of it, we’ll need the mako energy which lies dormant beneath this facility.
ev14_0060_0013;Are you sure that this “mako” energy is that strong?
ev14_0060_0014;Yeah. Trust me.
ev14_0060_0015;So wait, you mean...
ev14_0060_0016;Yep. This isn’t a coincidence.
ev14_0060_0017;Edgar sent you here as part of the operation. To perform a job.
ev14_0060_0018;Whoa whoa whoa whoa. So then, why didn’t he just [f2]ask[/f] us?
ev14_0060_0019;Figaro didn’t join the Federation willingly. It’s under constant watch.
ev14_0060_0020;Also, Edgar knew the Federation doesn’t do nice things to its prisoners.
ev14_0060_0021;Apparently, the real thorns in their side are kept...somewhere between life and death.
ev14_0060_0022;Life and death? Sounds like what that freak in the golden mask said back in Saronia.
ev14_0060_0023;So like, what’s this job we’re supposed to do?
ev14_0060_0024;Our target, Mako Reactor 0—it’s swarming with all kinds of dangerous Mirages.
ev14_0060_0025;Oh. Well, that makes sense, then.
ev14_0060_0026;Right. We were hoping that you two would be able to keep the Mirages at bay.
ev14_0060_0027;Except...it looks like your powers have been suppressed.
ev14_0060_0028;Well, um...we don’t really know. I mean, they’ve never been suppressed before...
ev14_0060_0029;But they’re useless now, I’m afraid.
ev14_0060_0030;Oops. So does that mean we, like, broke the master plan?
ev14_0060_0031;If we have to do this without any Keepers, then yes. The master plan is toast.
ev14_0060_0032;Uh...
ev14_0060_0033;Heh heh...
ev14_0060_0034;But, the operation’s in motion.
ev14_0060_0035;Use the eldboxes. And we’ll just have to hope for the best.
ev14_0060_0036;...Hm? You know... The League of S has an agent on-site.
ev14_0060_0037;I [f2]think[/f] she can remove the suppressors.
ev14_0060_0038;Yeah?
ev14_0060_0039;It’s possible, but I can’t promise you. Now, enough talking. Let’s press on.
