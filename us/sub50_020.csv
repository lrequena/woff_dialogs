sub50_020_0000;Guh, heh, heh, heh...[~]Mama tried to warn me that the real estate market was going to craaash...
sub50_020_0001;Whew... Seems all the books are still intact.[~]Thanks a lot, Cloud.
sub50_020_0002;I had my own reasons to help. Oh, and Celes...[~]Is that the libretto?
sub50_020_0003;Hm?
sub50_020_0004;Oh! It’s covered in that freak’s ink!
sub50_020_0005;I guess that means the opera’s canceled then.
sub50_020_0006;No, wait a sec![~]Maybe the duet at the end is still okay!
sub50_020_0007;Uh, well...it’s not like we can put on half an opera.
sub50_020_0008;Let’s just shelve this idea.[~]I’m sure we can find another way to cheer up the townspeople, right?
sub50_020_0009;Oh! Well...I suppose.
sub50_020_0010;What a shame too. You’ve got a nice voice.[~]Anyway, I’m gonna keep hunting through some more of these records.
sub50_020_0011;What do you know? So I wasn’t the star of either performance.[~]But that’s all right.
