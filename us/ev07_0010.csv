ev07_0010_0000_2;[s40]The Thane and the Knave[/s]
ev07_0010_0001;Welcome to Saronia.
ev07_0010_0002;Thank you for your help.[~]I’m going to go see my uncle now. Take care!
ev07_0010_0003;Hwuh?
ev07_0010_0004;What is it?
ev07_0010_0005;I just the-noticed... The whole the-town[~]seems to have a threshold around it.
ev07_0010_0006;Huh? Then, does that mean[~]there’s a powerful Mirage here in Saronia?
ev07_0010_0007;Very the-close. Keep an eye the-open.
ev07_0010_0008;Hey. What’s the matter?[~]I thought you’d gotten kind of quiet.
ev07_0010_0009;It’s so cold! I thought it would be warmer in this town[~]but it isn’t! Not at [f2]a-a-a-all![/f]
ev07_0010_0010;Mreowww!
ev07_0010_0011;Ah! What’d I step on?!
ev07_0010_0012;Ahh! I’m...sorry.
ev07_0010_0013;Ha ha, you’re such a weirdo.[~]Why are you apologizing to a cat?
ev07_0010_0014;But, you should have seen the look on its face![~]Scared the honk out of me.
