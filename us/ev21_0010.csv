ev21_0010_0000_2;[s40]Chaos in Grymoire[/s]
ev21_0010_0001;Okay, so where are we supposed to start?
ev21_0010_0002;Well, if we can track down Cloud, Squall, and Lightning, they could probably use a little help with the Cogna.
ev21_0010_0003;Right, but where are they? Rrrgh, we need more intel!
ev21_0010_0004;Oh! For that the-kind of stuff, you should definitely consult with Serafie.
ev21_0010_0005;Hang on while I go and the-get her!
ev21_0010_0006;Yeah, hi. So I suppose you’re gonna make me break out the old Rumor Radar for you.
ev21_0010_0007;Rumor Radar?
ev21_0010_0008;Oh, that’s my secret power, hon. It lets me instantly snap up every bit of gossip within my threshold.
ev21_0010_0009;In a teensy world like this, that basically only amounts to [f2]everything[/f].
ev21_0010_0010;Whoa, now [f2]that’s[/f] cool.
ev21_0010_0011;Huh? Is it cool?
ev21_0010_0012;Well, I’m no expert, but [f2]I’d[/f] say it is!
ev21_0010_0013;Wooo-hooo. I thought I’d never be one of those [f2]cool[/f] pixies.
ev21_0010_0014;Well, you’d be the-cooler if you picked up facts instead of rumors.
ev21_0010_0015;Thanks for that reminder.
ev21_0010_0016;Uh, well... So do you mind trying it?
ev21_0010_0017;Yeah, sure. I guess I’ll start us out by narrowing down the search to those Cogna we’re after. Sound good?
