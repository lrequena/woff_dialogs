SaloniaPortTown_npc_05_A_01;Ugh, I hate worrying about my civic rank.
SaloniaPortTown_npc_05_A_02;Normally I wouldn’t give two shakes of a chocobo’s tail feathers about it, but now that the Federation sends you to the slums if you don’t try to raise it, I don’t have a choice.
SaloniaPortTown_npc_05_B;Y-you want to go to the Low Seas? Sorry, but ask someone else...
SaloniaPortTown_npc_05_C;Sheesh. First the Federation and now rampaging machines? It’s just one headache after another.
SaloniaPortTown_npc_05_D_01;What a relief to have Saronia and the rest of the world back to normal. I do wonder why our thane hasn’t returned, though...
SaloniaPortTown_npc_05_D_02;Oh well! I guess we’ll just have to get to work fixing up this town by ourselves!
