SaloniaPortTown_npc_07_A;You’re kiddin’ me! You actually crossed Icicle Ridge to make it here? That’s completely insane! I like your style!
SaloniaPortTown_npc_07_B;You’re headin’ for the Low Seas? That’s completely insane! I can’t lend you a boat, but I’m rootin’ for ya!
SaloniaPortTown_npc_07_C;You’re kiddin’ me! You actually made it to the Low Seas and back? That’s the most insane thing I ever heard! I love it!
