sub42_010_0000;Hey, are you all right?
sub42_010_0001;Kweh? Kweh?
sub42_010_0002;Uh...yes. I think so.[~]I can’t thank you enough.
sub42_010_0003;Man. Since when did Grymoire get so grim, anyway?
sub42_010_0004;Kweeeh.
sub42_010_0005;Aw, don’t sweat it. Things’ll work out.[~]The two of us can handle anything!
sub42_010_0006;Kweh!
sub42_010_0007;Ahhh. A human who’s able to defeat the Cogna.[~]Is he a Medium? Or...has he already awakened?
sub42_010_0008;Either way...I know just what to do with him.
sub42_010_0009;Bartz...
sub42_010_0010;BAAARTZ!
sub42_010_0011;Please tell me you didn’t come here to start your nonsense again.
sub42_010_0012;There’s a time and a place, okay?[~]Right now I’m busy dismantling these doohickeys.
sub42_010_0013;Kweh.
sub42_010_0014;Bartz! I have awaited this day a thousand years!
sub42_010_0015;Did you just add a digit?!
sub42_010_0016;You’re not getting away without a duel this time![~]Don’t you want to defeat those...uh...
sub42_010_0017;Uh, Coggle... Caboggaboggle... Cnoggabog...[~]Whatever they are, I know how to stop them!
sub42_010_0018;Coggaboggle-noggabog-daboggawa— What?[~]You mean the Cogna? So you know a way to beat them?!
sub42_010_0019;Yes! Then what are we waiting for?![~]G-mesh, I must’ve had you all wrong!
sub42_010_0020;Kweh, kweh!
sub42_010_0021;Hey! This is far enough.[~]I wanna see this secret weapon you told me about right—
sub42_010_0022;Ha ha ha! I can’t believe that it was as easy as he said![~]Now that I have you alone, we can get our clash on! BARTZ!
sub42_010_0023;Huh? Who’s “he”?[~]Do you know a way to stop those machines or don’t you?
sub42_010_0024;No clue!
sub42_010_0025;[f2]What?![/f]
sub42_010_0026;Kweh?!
sub42_010_0027;I just told you what he said I should if I wanted you to play along.[~]Now let’s get right down to the main event!
sub42_010_0028;True, I may not remember the finer points...[~]But today is the day I finally pick that bone with you[~]that I’m fairly certain I have!
sub42_010_0029;Excellent work luring the Champion here.[~]You’ve served your purpose. Get lost.
sub42_010_0030;Huh? What?! But I haven’t had a chance to settle the score with Bartz!
sub42_010_0031;Silence! He’ll meet his demise at [f2]my[/f] hands!
sub42_010_0032;Once they hear I defeated a Champion,[~]my rise to greater glory is all but assur—
sub42_010_0033;Haven’t you ever heard of keeping your word?[~]You promised I would get to fight Bartz one-on-one.
sub42_010_0034;Whaddaya know... So [f2]that’s[/f] the story.[~]This Fed-head played you like a fiddle, Gilgamesh.
sub42_010_0035;Time for you to die!
sub42_010_0036;I’m...sorry, Bartz. Where did it all go wrong?!
sub42_010_0037;Aw man...[~]Once I’ve wiped the floor with these guys, you’re in for an earful!
sub42_010_0038;Kweh!
