ev14_0080_0003;The other agent is up ahead.
ev14_0080_0004;I’ll hold these clunkers off here.[~]Go on without me.
ev14_0080_0005;Hey, you can’t take them all on!
ev14_0080_0006;We’ll stay!
ev14_0080_0007;No. This is [f2]my[/f] job.
ev14_0080_0008;Go!
ev14_0080_0009;Uh, wait!
ev14_0080_0010;Come on.
ev14_0080_0011;Are you serious?
ev14_0080_0012;We can’t help him. We’d only get in the way.[~]Let’s just...do what he says.
ev14_0080_0013;...All right.
