ev18_0120_0001;Ugh... But like, shouldn’t we be floating?
ev18_0120_0002;Hmm... I think that this temple must have some kind of special the-power.
ev18_0120_0003;Don’t ask me the-how it works, but I sense some kind of force[~]that keeps people and Mirages from the-drifting too far away.
ev18_0120_0004;Hey, you’re right.[~]Something’s keeping us weighed down.
ev18_0120_0005;But on the bright side, it’s just like being on solid the-ground.[~]That’s especially the-helpful for you two, right?
ev18_0120_0006;Also, this is just the-wild guess but...
ev18_0120_0007;Whoa! No way!
ev18_0120_0008;In some areas, the walls have their own the-gravity.[~]Which lets us do cool the-stuff like this!
