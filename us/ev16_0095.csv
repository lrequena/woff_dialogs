ev16_0095_0000;You know, this might be my first time ever meeting an ordinary Jiant.
ev16_0095_0001;Back when I was a kid, I heard some towns still had folks like you. But nowadays, the only Jiants you run into are the soldiers in the Bahamutian Army.
ev16_0095_0002;Oh... I wonder what happened to them.
ev16_0095_0003;By the way, Bartz, you wouldn’t the-happen to be a summoner?
ev16_0095_0004;Me? No way! Boko here is just a really good friend.
ev16_0095_0005;Kweh!
ev16_0095_0006;You know, there are plenty of Mirages who live alongside humans by their own choice. There’s chocobos, and moogles...
ev16_0095_0007;Now that you mention it, I [f2]have[/f] seen moogles and chocobos wandering around Grymoire’s towns.
ev16_0095_0008;And Captain Faris was the-living with moogles, too.
ev16_0095_0009;Well, considering she’s best buddies with a giant sea dragon, I’d say she’s closer to something like a summoner or a Mirage Keeper.
ev16_0095_0010;Really? You sure know some interesting people.
