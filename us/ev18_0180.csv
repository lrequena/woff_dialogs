ev18_0180_0000;I can’t believe you found a quacho ruby![~]Wow, guys!
ev18_0180_0001;And the antidote?
ev18_0180_0002;Right here!
ev18_0180_0003;...Wooo! You sweet, delicious air, you!
ev18_0180_0004;I guess Doctor Shantotto wasn’t kidding.
ev18_0180_0005;The sea [f2]is[/f] another kind of hell.[~]I don’t think I’ve ever been so tired...
ev18_0180_0006;Oh! If you ever feel like going for another dip down there,[~]you’re gonna need these.
ev18_0180_0007;There you are![~]I’ve been looking all over!
ev18_0180_0008;Huh? Is that...?
ev18_0180_0009;Lady Yuna!
ev18_0180_0010;Huh? Friend of yours?
ev18_0180_0011;Hey there. I’m Tidus.
ev18_0180_0012;Oh! I-I’m the summoner Yuna.
ev18_0180_0013;Wow, a summoner![~]Never met one of those.
ev18_0180_0014;Good the-day, Lady the-Yuna!
ev18_0180_0015;Oh! Goo— Wait, what am I doing? Don’t “good the-day” me![~]It’s no time to mince “the’s.”
ev18_0180_0016;Awww.
ev18_0180_0017;Explain yourselves.[~]What did you two do to Rydia and Eiko?
ev18_0180_0018;Huh?
ev18_0180_0019;Hang on a second.[~]Did something happen to Rydia and Eiko?
ev18_0180_0020;Don’t pretend that you don’t know!
ev18_0180_0021;They’re gone.[~]Both of them went missing right after they ran into you!
ev18_0180_0022;What?
ev18_0180_0023;Really?
ev18_0180_0024;Then...you swear to me that you don’t know?[~]You really have no idea where my friends have been taken?
ev18_0180_0025;No clue.
ev18_0180_0026;No.
ev18_0180_0027;The-nope.
ev18_0180_0028;That’s...a shame.
ev18_0180_0029;I...might be going out on a limb,[~]but I can’t help but wonder if maybe...
ev18_0180_0030;What is it?
ev18_0180_0031;Maybe someone is targeting summoners. Specifically.
ev18_0180_0032;Targeting summoners?
ev18_0180_0033;Come to think of it, not long after I met you—
ev18_0180_0034;...Ah!
ev18_0180_0035;Eek!
ev18_0180_0036;Wha—?!
ev18_0180_0037;Lady Yuna!
ev18_0180_0038;You leave her to me!
ev18_0180_0039;Hey, wait up!
ev18_0180_0040;......!
ev18_0180_0041;Great. We’ve lost sight of them.
ev18_0180_0042;Rrgh! What’s that knight’s problem?
ev18_0180_0043;Was that the one who took the other summoners?
ev18_0180_0044;We’re just gonna have to hope[~]Tidus can keep Lady the-Yuna safe.
ev18_0180_0045;Huh?
ev18_0180_0046;Huh?! What’s happening now?
ev18_0180_0047;The keys.
ev18_0180_0048;The beasts have been unfettered...[~]And the two worlds...
ev18_0180_0049;Shall be joined again.
