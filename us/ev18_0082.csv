ev18_0082_0000;Question for you: what the-exactly is a [f2]quacho[/f] ruby?
ev18_0082_0001;Oh, good point. What [f2]is[/f] a quacho?
ev18_0082_0002;A quacho? Oh! There’s some right over there.
ev18_0082_0003;Their queen cries red tears which are called “quacho rubies.”
ev18_0082_0004;Now I see... But, those sound like they must be just about impossible to get.
ev18_0082_0005;True enough. They say she only sheds one tear every decade. The rubies go for at least a hundred million gil.
ev18_0082_0006;A hundred mil?!
ev18_0082_0007;I swear, that is the last time I ever consult a pantologist.
