sub27_010_0000;Hmm...[~]I should’ve known it wouldn’t be easy.
sub27_010_0001;Huh? Serafie?[~]Were you looking for me?
sub27_010_0002;Huh? Oh, no no. Since we’re both pixies, I thought hey,[~]I may as well ask her about transfiguration.
sub27_010_0003;Hm? Transfig? Why now?
sub27_010_0004;Now that Tama’s learned to transfig and get all godlike,[~]I can’t help but feel a bit...I don’t know if I’d say [f2]jealous[/f]...
sub27_010_0005;Uh, it’s more like...[~]Really, it’s just a pang. Just a smidge of micro-envy.
sub27_010_0006;Just a smidge, huh?
sub27_010_0007;It sounds tough. You have to go toe-to-toe with high-level Mirages...[~]I’m not sure I’m cut out for it—noncombatant and all that.
sub27_010_0008;Keee!
sub27_010_0009;Huh? You want to help her out?
sub27_010_0010;Kee!
sub27_010_0011;Hmm...
sub27_010_0012;Hee hee! How’s this:[~]maybe we three can help you out a “smidge.”
sub27_010_0013;Really? Dude, that’s sweet![~]...Uh, I did not mean to channel Lann just now.
sub27_010_0014;Hm? Wait a sec. “We three”?
sub27_010_0015;Never mind.[~]Now, Siren, call in a high-level Mirage.
sub27_010_0016;Slow down! I’m not sure I’m ready for this.
sub27_010_0017;Oh, it’ll be fine. Right?
sub27_010_0018;Hey. Who are you talking to now?!
sub27_010_0019;Keeaaah!
sub27_010_0020;Hey! When did [f2]you[/f] get on board?!
