ev03_0020_0000;Oh. Here’s another Gate.
ev03_0020_0001;That’s the-right. Gates the-usually turn up in towns or at the start of most Mirage-infested areas.
ev03_0020_0002;You never have to travel far to the-visit a place you’ve been!
ev03_0020_0003;Whenever you want to get from point the-A to point the-B, just use the Gate as a handy little shortcut.
ev03_0020_0004;A “shortcut,” huh?
ev03_0020_0005;So like, if we wanted to go back to Cornelia right this instant,
ev03_0020_0006;we could just take this Gate back to Nine Wood Hills, then we can take the Gate from there to Cornelia. You see?
ev03_0020_0007;All in all, it makes for a pretty short shortcut!
ev03_0020_0008;Yeah! If it were hair...
ev03_0020_0009;you’d have to call it... You’d have to call it a “buzzcut”!
ev03_0020_0010;Okay...
