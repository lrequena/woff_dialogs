ev17_0180_0000;You do know those monocles you’ve got there—I invented those some years ago.
ev17_0180_0001;What?
ev17_0180_0002;Wow, dude.
ev17_0180_0003;This was back before I got my new body. I was on a grand adventure to find new books,
ev17_0180_0004;and I noticed that the towns I visited had just the strangest spatial distortions. I naturally suspected the presence of hidden bookshops.
ev17_0180_0005;For the record, that’s not normal.
ev17_0180_0006;Well anyway, I decided to make a lens that corrected the distortions.
ev17_0180_0007;And when I saw a whopping [f2]no[/f] bookshops and a bunch of weird chains, I made a sad face, and gave my dear monocle away.
ev17_0180_0008;How much of a bibbity-file [f2]are[/f] you anyway?!
ev17_0180_0009;Later, someone asked how to make the lenses, so I generously passed the wisdom on.
ev17_0180_0010;And I guess those models found their way to Sherlotta’s inn.
