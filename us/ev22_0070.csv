ev22_0070_0000;Dad!
ev22_0070_0001;......
ev22_0070_0002;Thank you, son...
ev22_0070_0003;......!
ev22_0070_0023;Dad?
ev22_0070_0024;Dad! I’m... I... I’m sorry...[~]I... I couldn’t change it...
ev22_0070_0004;It’s my fault.[~]You’re gonna die...’cause of me.
ev22_0070_0005;I’ve been dead for many years now.[~][f2]I’m[/f] sorry, Lann.
ev22_0070_0006;If only I’d kept you safe from all this.[~]Instead, I left you with no one at all to turn to.
ev22_0070_0007;This here is just the shadow of my soul. My very last hurrah...[~]You see? There’s nothing to feel bad about.
ev22_0070_0008;Of course I feel bad about it!
ev22_0070_0009;Lann...
ev22_0070_0010;My son... Ha ha...
ev22_0070_0011;Wh-what is it?
ev22_0070_0012;Lann...I’m very proud.
ev22_0070_0013;About what?
ev22_0070_0014;You’ve grown up, son. Look at you. When people hurt, you hurt.[~]You fight for them. You’ve become someone[~]who cares about more than your own cause.
ev22_0070_0015;Hang on to that, and you’ll go far.
ev22_0070_0016;Dad!
ev22_0070_0017;Huff, huff, huff...
ev22_0070_0018;Nnh...!
