sub19_010_0001;Huh?! What do you mean some of the Black Mages have stopped moving?[~]How could that happen? I thought you were all training together the whole night!
sub19_010_0002;A Mirage...came to the training grounds[~]threatening to destroy us all?!
sub19_010_0003;Does that mean...it’s time?
sub19_010_0004;Hey, remember that conversation we had?[~]About what we’re doing in this world—what our purpose is?
sub19_010_0005;Our memories only go so far back, you know?[~]To the moment our paths crossed with Reynn and Lann.
sub19_010_0006;I think...maybe the reason we came to this world was so they could find us.[~]And once our job is done, it could be our lives are supposed to end.
sub19_010_0007;Thank you. Yeah, you’re right. However we started out,[~]that’s not who we are now. Together, we’ll drive that creature away!

sub19_010_0009;Tell me. Are you the Mirage hunting my friends?[~]What do you want? Just leave us alone!
sub19_010_0010;TOOLS DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE.[~]TOOLS THAT ARE NO LONGER USEFUL MUST BE DESTROYED.
sub19_010_0011;So much for trying to talk this one out.[~]Come on! We fight!
