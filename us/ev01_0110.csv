ev01_0110_0000;Anyway, I think you should be able to manage[~]on your own from here.
ev01_0110_0001;You mean you’re the-leaving us?
ev01_0110_0002;Yes. You handle things now.
ev01_0110_0003;Oh! Okay, I the-will!
ev01_0110_0004;It’s cool. I’ll lock this place down tighter[~]than a malboro’s bottle of mouthwash.[~]That’s a Serafie guarantee.
ev01_0110_0005;Huh? B-but where are you going now?
ev01_0110_0006;Oh, well... Somewhere else, of course.
ev01_0110_0007;Yeah, that’s not exactly very helpful.[~]Look, we really need to ask you so many things!
ev01_0110_0008;No no, you’ll figure it out.[~]I can’t do everything for you now.
ev01_0110_0009;Everything? But you’ve barely done anything.
ev01_0110_0010;Besides, every world has its own rules.[~]Like water dousing fire, and light banishing darkness.
ev01_0110_0011;Uhh, I think that’s just called “science”?
ev01_0110_0012;Well, I design mine to be so completely unbreakable[~]that even I can’t undo them.
ev01_0110_0013;Undo what?
ev01_0110_0014;The rules.
ev01_0110_0015;Ugh... You’re bad at explaining.
ev01_0110_0016;You’re saying you can’t help because[~]that violates the rules of the world or something?
ev01_0110_0017;Exactly.
ev01_0110_0018;But why [f2]is[/f] that? I mean, come on.[~]Just who do you think you are?
ev01_0110_0019;Me? Oh, well...
ev01_0110_0020;I’m god.
ev01_0110_0020_1;She's...gone.
ev01_0110_0021;Dude.
ev01_0110_0022;I guess we can’t [f2]necessarily[/f] rule it out.[~]But for somebody calling the cosmic shots...
ev01_0110_0023;she seems kind of sub-benevolent.
ev01_0110_0024;Well, that’s Enna Kros for you, so get used to it.
ev01_0110_0025;So...she really is god?
ev01_0110_0026;Beats me.[~]Enna Kros is Enna Kros, wouldn’t you say?
ev01_0110_0027;Pretty the-much.
ev01_0110_0028;Uh, thanks for clearing it up.
