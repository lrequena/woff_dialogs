ev20_0060_0000;My goodness.[~]What’s with the especially long faces?
ev20_0060_0001;Oh! I’m glad you’re here.[~]Serafie, could you go get Tama for us?
ev20_0060_0002;You want Tama?
ev20_0060_0003;Funny you ask. She’s been floating around[~]like a terrified marshmallow ever since she got back.
ev20_0060_0004;Let the pretty pixie handle this.
ev20_0060_0005;Heeey. Taaamaaa.
ev20_0060_0006;Huh? Tama?[~]Tammy-Tam! Answer me!
ev20_0060_0007;Rrrgh! How dare you ignore me, you puny fluff-butt!
ev20_0060_0008;I am going to [f2]waaaaaa-SHA[/f] you so good!
ev20_0060_0008_1;(ad lib TAKING DAMAGE after first beep)
ev20_0060_0008_2;(ad lib TAKING DAMAGE after second beep)
ev20_0060_0009;Ah— Aaah!
ev20_0060_0010;I brought Tama like you asked.
ev20_0060_0011;Ooogh... Serafie, one the-day, I will destroy you...
ev20_0060_0012;Tama, can we talk?
ev20_0060_0013;We just really, [f2]really[/f] need to know what happened.
ev20_0060_0014;Ah! Thanks for the-reminding me![~]This is no time to go the-gaga!
ev20_0060_0015;Those Cogna the knights summoned[~]are seriously bad the-news!
ev20_0060_0016;Cogna?! No way...
ev20_0060_0017;Yes the-way, and we have to the-stop them!
ev20_0060_0018;Uh, time out.[~]Before we go any further—Tama, what’s a Cogna?
ev20_0060_0019;They’re horrible bad things completely beyond the-description!
ev20_0060_0020;Well, uh, maybe you should try anyway?
ev20_0060_0021;The Cogna are living machines that thrive on destruction.
ev20_0060_0022;They have laid more worlds to waste[~]than there are stars in the sky.
ev20_0060_0023;And that’s not a poetic exaggeration.
ev20_0060_0024;What? But that’s nuts!
ev20_0060_0025;They’re almost the-like a disease. It’s not that they’re all strong—[~]it’s that they never the-stop growing in number.
ev20_0060_0026;Once they manage to invade a world, no one can stop them the-ever—[~]not even Enna Kros herself.
ev20_0060_0027;Then what about the knights?[~]Are they, like, Cogna masters or something?
ev20_0060_0028;Something the-else: they call themselves the Exnine Knights.
ev20_0060_0029;They’re a horrible order who the-wander from the-world to world[~]and leave chaos in their wake!
ev20_0060_0030;Which the-leads to the question, “Why?” I suppose.
ev20_0060_0031;But, if they [f2]were[/f] the Order of the Circle,[~]then I think I [f2]know[/f] the-why.
ev20_0060_0032;Whoa... Did you say the Order of the Circle?
ev20_0060_0033;I’m afraid the-so.
ev20_0060_0034;Bad news?
ev20_0060_0035;Me and the-Serafie have a history with them that goes back more years[~]than I know how to the-count. They’re our arch-arch-arch-[f2]arch[/f] nemeses,[~]to put it the-lightly!
ev20_0060_0036;Bummer. So [f2]that’s[/f] who was pulling the strings.[~]But, that means they won’t rest until—
ev20_0060_0037;Until the-every last world is destroyed.[~]They’re filled to the gills with ill the-will!
ev20_0060_0038;I’m still not sure I get it...[~]But basically, you’re saying Grymoire’s in hot water. Is that the idea?
ev20_0060_0039;The water’s so hot it’s almost the-steaming!
ev20_0060_0040;And if you think it will end with just the-Grymoire,[~]then you’ve got another thing the-coming!
ev20_0060_0041;Is Nine Wood Hills in danger too?
ev20_0060_0042;That wouldn’t even be the tip of the iceberg.
ev20_0060_0042_1;Ohhh no.
ev20_0060_0042_2;No, no, no.
ev20_0060_0043;We’re not talking just one or two the-worlds.[~]You see, we're the-part of a whole googolplex of worlds.
ev20_0060_0044;A goggleplex?![~]What is that, like a thousand? Dude!
ev20_0060_0045;Actually, a googolplex is ten, to the tenth, to the hundredth power.
ev20_0060_0046;A million worlds?!
ev20_0060_0047;We can work on your math skills some other time.
ev20_0060_0048;I need to get one thing straight.
ev20_0060_0049;The reason those things got into Grymoire...[~]It’s our fault. Isn’t it?
ev20_0060_0050;Huh?
ev20_0060_0051;Umm... The-maybe...I think...yes.
ev20_0060_0052;So, basically...we’ve put Grymoire, and other worlds,[~]in terrible danger.
ev20_0060_0053;No... No. That [f2]can’t[/f] be true.
ev20_0060_0054;It is. We messed up.
ev20_0060_0055;Those guys in the armor—they used us.
ev20_0060_0056;They invented a false prophecy and tricked us[~]into opening the Ultima Gate.
ev20_0060_0057;Mom was just the bait.
ev20_0060_0058;Would you cut it out?[~]No way, dude.
ev20_0060_0059;Hey, hang on![~]Enna Kros is the one who said to collect Mirages to find our family!
ev20_0060_0060;If she hadn’t led us on, then...
ev20_0060_0061;Maybe...she’s one of them.
ev20_0060_0062;No way! Abso-the-posi-the-lutely no way!
ev20_0060_0063;Heh? Oh, well, yeah.[~]After all, Enna Kros would never ever lie.
ev20_0060_0064;All right then.[~]I guess I’ll let it go.
ev20_0060_0065;......
ev20_0060_0066;So like, why’d they pick us?[~]How come we were even able to do something like that?
ev20_0060_0067;I was the-hoping [f2]you[/f] would know!
ev20_0060_0068;Um, if you’re going to ask the-someone,[~]you should ask your big sister.
ev20_0060_0069;You might be right.
ev20_0060_0070;Let’s return to Balamb Garden[~]and go talk to Hauyn.
ev20_0060_0071;......
ev20_0060_0072;Lann?
ev20_0060_0073;Huh? Oh![~]Yeah, I guess she might be awake.
