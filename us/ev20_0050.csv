ev20_0050_0000;Sorry, guys. I need to get back to the control room and handle this mess.
ev20_0050_0001;Look, I realize that you two are probably trustworthy.
ev20_0050_0002;But the League does have its rules.
ev20_0050_0003;Until you get clearance, restricted areas like the infirmary are off limits.
ev20_0050_0004;If you want to explore, keep it to here and the lobby.
ev20_0050_0005;Okay? Catch up later.
ev20_0050_0006;So basically, she doesn’t trust us at all.
ev20_0050_0007;Well, you can’t blame her.
ev20_0050_0008;Okay, so, what do we do now?
ev20_0050_0009;Hmm... I’m worried about all our friends. We really do need to talk to Tama.
ev20_0050_0010;Yeah, that’s for sure. I keep calling her, but she just doesn’t show up.
ev20_0050_0011;I don’t think she plans to leave Nine Wood Hills. C’mon, why don’t we go see if we can cheer her up.
