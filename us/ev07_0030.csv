ev07_0030_0000;I said for ya to scram, kid!
ev07_0030_0001;Will you just listen to what I have to say?
ev07_0030_0002;Is that...Refia?
ev07_0030_0003;Oh! You caught up.
ev07_0030_0004;What’s going on here?[~]They giving you trouble?
ev07_0030_0005;I already told them that the thane is my uncle.[~]I’m not allowed to talk to my own flesh and blood now?
ev07_0030_0006;I don’t care who y’er supposed to be,[~]’cause y’ain’t seein’ him!
ev07_0030_0007;Dude, what?
ev07_0030_0008;Well, you see, sir, we are here to meet the thane,[~]on behalf of Princess Sarah of Cornelia.
ev07_0030_0009;Have a look for yourselves.[~]That’s the Cornelian seal.
ev07_0030_0010;What now?
ev07_0030_0011;I expected better from you,[~]considering you’re practically our neighbors.
ev07_0030_0012;Yeah! You tell him, Reynn!
ev07_0030_0013;Cornelia’s got Jiants for emissaries?
ev07_0030_0013_1;They got some kinda royal Cornelia thing with ’em.
ev07_0030_0013_2;What? You sure?
ev07_0030_0013_3;Beats me.[~]You gonna send ’em packin’ and take the risk?
ev07_0030_0014;Wait here. I’ll go check with His Thaneship.
ev07_0030_0015;The thane says he’ll see you.
ev07_0030_0016;Let’s go, Refia.
ev07_0030_0017;Huh?
ev07_0030_0018;Hey! The girl stays here.
ev07_0030_0019;Refia’s part of our antourage.
ev07_0030_0020;That’s right. She just “ant”-eceded us.
ev07_0030_0021;But—
ev07_0030_0022;Toodle-oo.
ev07_0030_0023;Thank you, guys![~]You’re always there for me.
ev07_0030_0024;No big deal.
ev07_0030_0025;Yeah, I mean, it wasn’t a lie.[~]We [f2]were[/f] all heading in more[~]or less the same direction.
ev07_0030_0026;You must be the Jiant emissaries from Cornelia.
ev07_0030_0027;Oh, uh, yes. We’re here to—
ev07_0030_0028;I hear the Federation finally gave up[~]and just invaded them.
ev07_0030_0029;Are you telling me the invasion failed? Hm?[~]Are you here to ask for my help?
ev07_0030_0030;Yes, they did try to invade, but for the moment—
ev07_0030_0031;Who are you?
ev07_0030_0032;Hm? Why, Refia. Is that you?
ev07_0030_0033;Who are you?!
ev07_0030_0034;My dear, please. It’s me, your uncle—
ev07_0030_0035;No! You are [f2]not[/f] Uncle Takka!
ev07_0030_0036;Wait. Sorry. What?
ev07_0030_0037;Ha ha ha ha! Then I was right.[~]If you’ve managed to see through this facade,[~]then there’s no mistake: you [f2]are[/f] a Medium.
ev07_0030_0038;Yes, I was wise to make sure you left town,[~]and to ensure that you never returned.
ev07_0030_0039;Where’s Uncle Takka?
ev07_0030_0040;Why, he’s standing right in front of you.[~]Make no mistake, little girl. This is your uncle.
ev07_0030_0041;NOT USED
ev07_0030_0042;What are you...
ev07_0030_0043;How intriguing. This must be an act of fate.
ev07_0030_0044;The Jiants from the Hills, here.[~]And with them, a Champion’s Medium!
ev07_0030_0045;And not just any Medium—[~]one that bleeds the same blood as this body.
ev07_0030_0046;Ha ha ha! It’s more than fate.[~]It has to be destiny![~]How can I not rise to it!
ev07_0030_0047;That answers that.[~][f2]He’s[/f] the one who put up the threshold here.
