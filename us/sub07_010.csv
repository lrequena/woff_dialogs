sub07_010_0000;Reynn and Lann... They sure were a fun pair to have around![~]Oh, could you bear a little more to the right please?
sub07_010_0001;So, Rikku, was it?[~]Where might you be headed this fine day?
sub07_010_0002;Hee hee hee.[~]Do you really need to ask? Treasure Island!
sub07_010_0003;Ahhh. So the Low Seas[~]have managed to keep a few secrets from me.
sub07_010_0004;It’s full of treasure chests![~]Now that’s what I call a paradise!
sub07_010_0005;The currents are so strong, I never could have made the trip all by my lonesome.[~]It sure is a good thing I found [f2]you[/f], Addy-boy.
sub07_010_0006;You’d risk your life to reach this place?[~]I wonder if treasure hunting is as fun as you say.
sub07_010_0007;It sure is!
sub07_010_0008;All those little trejjies have been around way longer than I have.[~]I’ll be the first person to touch them in years upon years...
sub07_010_0009;Oooh, I could just squeal!
sub07_010_0010;Hmm... I see now.[~]I had that same spark ages ago. How I miss it.
sub07_010_0011;Yeah? Well, why don’t you come along on this treasure hunt with me?
sub07_010_0012;I would, but I cannot survive outside the Low Seas.
sub07_010_0013;I envy you. Living life as you please—[~]now that is a true treasure.
sub07_010_0014;Hmm...if you say so.[~]Oh! There’s the island! I see it!
sub07_010_0015;Whoooa! Look at all these treasure chests![~]Hey Addy, thanks so much for the ride!
sub07_010_0016;No trouble at all.[~]How will you get home?
sub07_010_0017;Look at all the stuff lying around here![~]There’s gotta be [f2]some[/f] relic that’ll help me.
sub07_010_0018;Oh, hey. Why don’t you take something with you?
sub07_010_0019;I don’t know what’s in that chest there,[~]but it’s sure gonna be something good!
sub07_010_0020;Aaah! Mimic traaap!
sub07_010_0021;Rikku. I will help you.
sub07_010_0022;You’d do that? You’re so sweet.[~]Now...get that cheeest!
