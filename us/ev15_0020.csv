ev15_0020_0000;Should I assume I’ve won?
ev15_0020_0001;Unless you fight back,[~]you are going to die.
ev15_0020_0002;Nngh... If I look dead to you, then guess again!
ev15_0020_0003;Agh!
ev15_0020_0004;Lann!
ev15_0020_0005;......!
ev15_0020_0006;Agh!
ev15_0020_0007;Good. That’s more like it.
ev15_0020_0008;Countertek deployed.[~]There is no method they can utilize...[~]that I can’t neutralize.
ev15_0020_0009;Wakey the-wakey wakey!
ev15_0020_0010;Wha...?
ev15_0020_0011;Huh? Tama!
ev15_0020_0012;That’s the-me![~]Boy, am I ever the-glad to see you!
ev15_0020_0013;Dude. Finally!
ev15_0020_0014;What a relief. We’re all fixed!
ev15_0020_0015;When I realized I couldn’t the-reach you,[~]I was so the-upset!
ev15_0020_0016;If your powers have recovered,[~]we need to keep going.
ev15_0020_0017;Oh! Isn’t Shelke here the-completely amazing?[~]She’s the-with the, uh...[~]Oh, that’s the-right, the League of S!
ev15_0020_0018;I knew it![~]She [f2]is[/f] the other agent!
ev15_0020_0019;So. Are you done?[~]Because we need to keep—
ev15_0020_0020;That thing she did,[~]I think that it’s called Counter-the-tek?
ev15_0020_0021;Any-the-way, it can take any the-kind of magic or technique,[~]any old the-move at all, and completely nullify it!
ev15_0020_0022;Yes... That’s right.
ev15_0020_0023;Whoa. That’s so cool!
ev15_0020_0024;And that’s the-what she used[~]to remove your suppressors!
ev15_0020_0025;Although, she wasn’t sure it the-worked,[~]so she was kind of the-freaking the-out!
ev15_0020_0026;What? Th-that is not true at all![~]I was...completely in control.
ev15_0020_0027;If you ask the-me, she’s a Champion! Woo![~]How can you not the-love her! Am I the-right?
ev15_0020_0028;You sure are.[~]Thank you for the help.
ev15_0020_0029;Yeah! You’re the bestest!
ev15_0020_0030;I...I don’t have time for this.
