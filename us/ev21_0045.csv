ev21_0045_0000;A cathedral, huh?
ev21_0045_0001;Where are we supposed to find that?
ev21_0045_0002;Remember that strange town we visited—the one where you said something felt kind of “off”?
ev21_0045_0003;Yeah, the one where you told me we should keep a low profile, right?
ev21_0045_0004;I bet that was a cathedral in the middle of town.
ev21_0045_0005;We’ve seen lots of towns like that the-since. We shouldn’t have to go the-far to find one.
ev21_0045_0006;Well, Quistis said we’d find one at the heart of every Federation town.
ev21_0045_0007;Oh! Remember that town that gave me the heebie-the-jeebies?
ev21_0045_0008;We’ve seen lots of towns like that the-since. We shouldn’t have to go the-far to find one!
