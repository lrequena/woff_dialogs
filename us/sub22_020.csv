sub22_020_0000;Princess Goblin! It’s over!
sub22_020_0000_2;OHHH MYYY GAWWWB!
sub22_020_0001;Wait! Warrior of Light!
sub22_020_0001_2;Wheh?
sub22_020_0002;Highness. Please step aside.[~]I can’t allow this evil Mirage to continue in her foul ways.
sub22_020_0002_2;Nooo!
sub22_020_0003;No, I will not.[~]Despite her poor judgment, her heart is in the right place.
sub22_020_0003_2;Yeah!
sub22_020_0004;Can you blame her?[~]Like any princess, all that she desired was a dashing gentleman.
sub22_020_0004_2;Oh, for sure!
sub22_020_0005;It is no less noble than what I do for my kingdom.
sub22_020_0005_2;Yes it is.
sub22_020_0006;Princess...
sub22_020_0006_2;H-huh?
sub22_020_0007;Now, if you genuinely wish to protect me, then please.[~]Put your sword away.
sub22_020_0007_2;Y-yeah, please?
sub22_020_0008;Very well. If it is [f2]your[/f] wish I show mercy,[~]then I will stay my blade.
sub22_020_0009;*Sniff*... Bwaaah! Bwaaah!
sub22_020_0010;Wh-what is the matter? Are you hurt?
sub22_020_0011;*Sniff* *Sob* After all of the terrible things I went and did to you,[~]why are you so [f2]nice?![/f] I feel like such an awful meanie!
sub22_020_0012;Bwaaah!
sub22_020_0013;You’re right. Her Highness is as caring as they come.[~]Why else would I have fallen in... Uh...
sub22_020_0014;Princess Sarah... Oh, I am [f2]so[/f] not worthy! You win,[~]I must accept my defeat! So long! ...Oh, hey, from now on, I’m going to be[~]a better ruler and look after my goblins! So long!
sub22_020_0015;Oh, and I hope there aren’t any hard feelings. So long![~]...And like, if you ever need me for anything,[~]I’ll be here in a goblin minute, so just say the word!
sub22_020_0016;...Right. We’ll keep you posted.
sub22_020_0016_2;So looong!
sub22_020_0017;What a selfless and courageous princess she turned out to be.
sub22_020_0018;A fine ruler—willing to change when necessary.[~]Just the sort of example I should strive to imitate.
sub22_020_0019;No! Your Highness is fine the way you are.[~]If you need help, I will always be there to assist you.
sub22_020_0020;Hee hee... I am beginning to see I am in good hands.[~]Thank you, sir.
sub22_020_0021;Y-Your Highness?
sub22_020_0022;There’s no telling what Mirages might lie just around the bend.[~]I trust that you will keep me safe until we return home?
sub22_020_0023;...Right. Then I suggest you stay as close to me as possible.
sub22_020_0024;Hee hee! I love thrilling adventures.[~]We should have another one.
sub22_020_0025;Oh no no. We need to adopt a strict “no more abductions” rule.[~]Never again...
sub22_020_0026;Ooooooh! My Warrior of Light! Princess Sarah invited me over for a little social time.
sub22_020_0027;Couldn’t you have the grace to turn the invitation down?
sub22_020_0028;Don’t say that, smoochy-poo! Not after everything we’ve been through together.
sub22_020_0029;What have we been through?
sub22_020_0029_2;Whuh? Y-you’re going to make me spell it out for you? B-but I... Ohhh...
sub22_020_0030;Great, now I have something else to worry about.
sub22_020_0030_2;What are you worried about, smoochy-poo? I’m here!
