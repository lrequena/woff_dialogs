sub02_050_0000;Dah! What just happened?
sub02_050_0001;Whoa! We’ve still got the prismarium!
sub02_050_0002;When we do that,[~]what does the other person experience?
sub02_050_0003;Even time must bend to the whims of fantasy.
sub02_050_0004;This place is power. Here, dreams and reality and time all touch.[~]All that was, and all that is, and all that will be.
sub02_050_0005;From here, you changed history.[~]You don’t have to worry—the souls you help are not able to see you.
sub02_050_0006;And yet, everything that you accomplish, on their behalf,[~]becomes something that [f2]they[/f] accomplish. So if you come here,
sub02_050_0007;fight someone’s battle for them, and emerge victorious—[~]what they see is the same battle won the same way, but by their own hand.
sub02_050_0008;Uh, that is totally confusing, but wow![~]So, we get to help a bunch of people out—
sub02_050_0009;[f2]and[/f] we get to keep all the prismariums we find?[~]There’s like, [f2]no[/f] downsides at all!
sub02_050_0010;Seems that way.
sub02_050_0011;[f2]But, in a way, there is a downside.[~]With that much power, we could do as much harm as we do good.[/f]
sub02_050_0012;[f2]This room of hers affects the destinies of so many...[~]Which makes her what exactly? Is she like Enna Kros? A god?[/f]
sub02_050_0013;I wouldn’t say I’m a god in the sense you’re thinking of.
sub02_050_0014;Huh?!
sub02_050_0014_1;But if you misuse this power,[~]you might not like the consequences.
sub02_050_0014_2;Consequences?
sub02_050_0015;Me and...him?—is it “her”?—well, our fates have entwined.[~]So now that the two of you have made it to this place,
sub02_050_0016;I suppose she’d want me to share[~]a little of this power over time and fantasy.
sub02_050_0017;We uh, won’t mess around. I promise.
sub02_050_0018;Good.
