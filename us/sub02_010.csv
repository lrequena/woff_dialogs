sub02_010_0000;What’s this thing?
sub02_010_0001;It sure looks like a door.[~]But does it even go anywhere?
sub02_010_0002;Hellooo! ...Let’s check it out.
sub02_010_0003;Wh-wha— Hey!
sub02_010_0004;Uh...what?
sub02_010_0005;Where are we now?
sub02_010_0006;Visitors?[~]What an unusual surprise!
sub02_010_0007;Um, who are you?[~]And...where [f2]are[/f] we?
sub02_010_0008;My name is... Huh?[~]It was right there on the tip of my tongue. Use it or lose it, I suppose.
sub02_010_0009;Oh, but this is my tearoom.[~]So who are you? Will you join me for tea?
sub02_010_0010;Uh, well, you might say that we’re sort of passing through.[~]But I’m Lann, and this is...
sub02_010_0011;It’s Reynn. And my brother and I are from Nine Wood Hills.
sub02_010_0012;Lann and Reynn from Nine Wood Hills...
sub02_010_0013;Of course! I had a dream about this![~]I saw the two of you come here. Today’s the day.
sub02_010_0014;Huh?
sub02_010_0015;Right, I think I might know why you’ve come here.[~]Shall we get started?
sub02_010_0016;Uh... Sorry, come again? You know what me and Reynn are doing here,[~]even though [f2]we[/f] don’t have the slightest clue?
sub02_010_0017;Mm-hm. You’re Keepers looking for new Mirages.[~]You’ve come to touch the souls of your friends—[~]their past, present, and future.
sub02_010_0018;To step into their shoes and fight—[~]when Mirages threaten them and they need you most—
sub02_010_0019;to sway them towards success. Correct?
sub02_010_0020;Uh, I...don’t know?
sub02_010_0021;Whoa dude! That was a lot of words.[~]Hey Reynn, you follow that?
sub02_010_0022;Uh-uh... Nope. I’m officially lost.
sub02_010_0023;So, whose soul will you touch?
