ev01_0019_0000;Before you can imprism a Mirage, you need to the-get your hands on an empty prism for that Mirage.
ev01_0019_0001;Some empty prisms can be found in treasure the-chests, and others are dropped by Mirages you defeat. Chocolatte even the-sells them in her shop!
ev01_0019_0002;Wait, Chocolatte carries them too?
ev01_0019_0003;I don’t know the-where she manages to find them, but the last the-time I popped into her shop, there they were!
ev01_0019_0004;Wow! Chatty lady really knows her stuff.
