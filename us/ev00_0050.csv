ev00_0050_0000;There’s nobody here!
ev00_0050_0001;So it’s a quiet morning. Maybe they just...
ev00_0050_0002;I. Mean. No one!
ev00_0050_0003;Huh?
ev00_0050_0004;Lann, have you bumped into anyone today?[~]Besides her?
ev00_0050_0005;Uh...now that you mention it, I guess not.
ev00_0050_0006;And this isn’t setting off any alarms?
ev00_0050_0007;Should it?
ev00_0050_0008;You two really don’t remember a thing.
ev00_0050_0009;Huh? What was that?
ev00_0050_0010;Who are you?[~]If you’re from around town,[~]then I don’t know you.
ev00_0050_0011;Reynn, manners.
ev00_0050_0012;You two really don’t remember a thing.
ev00_0050_0013;Would you please just answer my question?
ev00_0050_0014;You can call me Enna...Kros.[~]Enna Kros will work.
ev00_0050_0015;Okay, well...we woke up to a ghost town this morning.[~]Maybe you know why?
ev00_0050_0016;Yes, you’re quite alone.[~]But you always have been.
ev00_0050_0017;Huh?
ev00_0050_0018;This world, it’s always been the two of you.[~]A world without time, one that ended when it began.
ev00_0050_0019;Wha? That’s the weirdest thing I’ve heard.
ev00_0050_0020;But don’t worry.[~]Just because the world ended,[~]doesn’t mean that it’s going anywhere.
ev00_0050_0021;You know, I [f2]have[/f] been checking up on you two.[~]Until now you were nothing but blank stares.
ev00_0050_0022;So imagine my surprise when Lann took my order![~]What a morning.
ev00_0050_0023;Okay...now you’re kind of scaring me.
ev00_0050_0024;So! Now that you’re awake, we’ve got a story to tell.
ev00_0050_0025;Which brings us to...Tama!
ev00_0050_0026;Right the-here!
ev00_0050_0027;Aaah! Who the honk put [f2]this[/f] thing on my head?!
ev00_0050_0028;Yeah, I did try to mention it before.
ev00_0050_0029;You take it from here.[~]I’ll go on ahead and link up a path.
ev00_0050_0030;You the-got it!
ev00_0050_0031;Huh? H-hey, you can’t just leave!
ev00_0050_0032;Salu-the-tations! The name is Tama and I’m the-here[~]to help out. Does anyone the-have any questions?
ev00_0050_0033;Hmm... Wait, I've got [f2]tons[/f] of questions!
ev00_0050_0034;Why were you sitting on my head?[~]And how the honk can a fox even [f2]talk?![/f]
ev00_0050_0035;That’s the-seriously the first thing on your mind?
ev00_0050_0036;Ugh... Now I the-see why Enna Kros[~]was just about the-ready to throw in the towel.
ev00_0050_0037;We’re not allowed to be confused?!
ev00_0050_0038;Hey whoa, take it easy there, Lann.
ev00_0050_0039;I thought [f2]you[/f] were upset too!
ev00_0050_0040;Let’s start the-over. I’ll make us some the-coffee.
ev00_0050_0041;Oh, yes please!
ev00_0050_0042;But...I already made some coffee before you got here.[~]How can you just roll with this, Reynn?!
ev00_0050_0043;Chill the-ouuut. You’ll live the-much longer.
ev00_0050_0044;Yeah, Lann.[~]You shouldn’t start out your morning with so much stress.
ev00_0050_0045;Oh! Would you the-like some sugar?
ev00_0050_0046;Three cubes for you, right, Lann?[~]I’m good with just one.
ev00_0050_0047;Okay! I’ll the-go and put the coffee on.
ev00_0050_0048;But I just [f2]said[/f] I... Ugh.[~]You know what, just give me my dang cup of coffee.
