PortTown_Quest_npc_01_A_01;This letter just isn’t enough... If only I had...
PortTown_Quest_npc_01_A_02;Wait, you wouldn’t happen to be Mirage Keepers, would you?
PortTown_Quest_npc_01_A_03;I’m looking for some fish scales. You wouldn’t happen to have any you can spare, would you?
PortTown_Quest_npc_01_B;I need those scales more than anything! Please!
PortTown_Quest_npc_01_C_01;Thanks a bunch! Now I’m finally confident enough to give her my letter.
PortTown_Quest_npc_01_C_02;Hm? What do I need them for? Well, I’m going to use them to decorate my proposal letter.
PortTown_Quest_npc_01_C_03;It’s kind of a family tradition. We believe that when you ask someone to marry you, giving them fish scales will ensure they say “yes”!
PortTown_Quest_npc_01_C_04;Don’t laugh! I get it. I know that fish scales aren’t exactly the first thing that comes to mind when people think about romance. But have you ever really looked at them? They’re one of the most beautiful things out there!
PortTown_Quest_npc_01_C_05;Anyway, you really helped me out. Here, this is for you.
PortTown_Quest_npc_01_D;Oh man, now what do I do? I finished decorating my letter, but I’m too scared to give it to her!
PortTown_Quest_npc_01_E;Ugh... Without those scales, there’s no way I can go through with it...
