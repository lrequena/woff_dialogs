ev22_0020_0000;Tell me one thing.[~]This time, do you remember?
ev22_0020_0001;What you two were like?[~]And the terrible things you did?
ev22_0020_0002;Yes. A lot of it, anyway.
ev22_0020_0003;But we’re ready. We’re going to collect our Mirages,[~]and face all of our mistakes head-on.
ev22_0020_0004;......
ev22_0020_0005;......
ev22_0020_0006;All right then.[~]So why did you call me back?
ev22_0020_0007;If we have the final showdown now, our fam—[~]You and us won’t make it.
ev22_0020_0008;It’s not gonna be the outcome that we’re hoping for.
ev22_0020_0009;You don’t know that.[~]It hasn’t even—
ev22_0020_0010;I [f2]do[/f] know![~]Look...I was there.
ev22_0020_0011;......?
ev22_0020_0012;Please. Don’t fight the Heralds yet.[~]Help us save Grymoire first. We could really, really use your help.
ev22_0020_0013;NOT USED
ev22_0020_0014;Do you have a plan?
ev22_0020_0015;We’re going to use the portal.
ev22_0020_0016;The Ultima Gate?[~]What do you want with that?
ev22_0020_0017;If you’re thinking about opening it again...
ev22_0020_0018;No, it would never work without you, Wyn.[~]Well...actually, we need all of the summoners for it to work.
ev22_0020_0019;Lann is right. Summoners have the power[~]to bring Mirages from other worlds into this one.
ev22_0020_0020;Basically, they create a bridge between two worlds.
ev22_0020_0021;But so can you.[~]In fact, the power is stronger in Mirage Keepers.
ev22_0020_0022;Don’t look at me.[~]I’m just regougitating all the stuff that Reynn told me she remembers now.
ev22_0020_0023;A Mirage Keeper’s powers—[~]they’re not like those of a summoner’s.
ev22_0020_0024;We trap Mirages, using miniature worlds that are created[~]by real Architects like our father. And once they’re confined,
ev22_0020_0025;we can release them, and at that point they’re ours to command at will.[~]But to pull that off, you need to bend the rules.
ev22_0020_0026;And only Breakers like our mother can do that.
ev22_0020_0027;Is that true? So then, your parents’ talents—[~]they became yours: to wield any Mirage.
ev22_0020_0028;Yes. And there’s more to it. Breakers can extract power[~]from any of their Mirages, and then add it to their own.
ev22_0020_0029;So the more we find,[~]the stronger me and Reynn can make ourselves.
ev22_0020_0030;We didn’t give it much thought when we were collecting them back then,[~]but, in fact, we stole our mom’s power along with her Mirages.
ev22_0020_0031;Wait. If you can’t—[~]If Keepers can’t actually connect two worlds...
ev22_0020_0032;NOT USED
ev22_0020_0033;Yeah... When I summoned Brandelis?[~]I, uh... I sorta had to borrow [f2]your[/f] powers, Wyn.
ev22_0020_0034;I used the crystal cage.
ev22_0020_0035;That explains it. I could [f2]feel[/f] it, too.[~]It’s like the cage—it was drawing the strength right out of me.
ev22_0020_0036;And while I was trapped in there,[~]the Heralds could draw on my power, and even pose as me.
ev22_0020_0037;Wait a minute.[~]Then, did they—
ev22_0020_0038;Yes. They slowly deceived the world with the Crimson Prophecy,[~]so that Lann would restore the gate.
ev22_0020_0039;And by gathering up the other summoners,[~]again, they managed to create a bridge.
ev22_0020_0040;Right.
ev22_0020_0041;That explains a lot of things... Okay, so going back.[~]The Ultima Gate—why do you need it?
ev22_0020_0042;It’s too late to destroy it.
ev22_0020_0043;We know. Even if we do, or take out Brandelis—
ev22_0020_0044;Then we’re still stuck[~]with a world full of Cogna we can’t get rid of.
ev22_0020_0045;So, we’ll reverse it.
ev22_0020_0046;What?
ev22_0020_0047;Right. We hope, if we reverse the flow...
ev22_0020_0048;It’ll send the Cogna and Heralds[~]back where they came from.
ev22_0020_0049;So please. If you and the summoners help us,[~]we can [f2]do[/f] this, Hauyn.
ev22_0020_0050;I, uh... I know that after all we’ve done,[~]we don’t have any right to ask this. But...
ev22_0020_0051;I’ll do it.
ev22_0020_0052;Huh?
ev22_0020_0053;Honestly, I’m not so sure about your plan.[~]It might work like you say. And then again, it might not.
ev22_0020_0054;But I feel like it’s something worth trying.
ev22_0020_0055;Still...
ev22_0020_0056;Yes. They’ll come after us if they catch on.
ev22_0020_0057;It’s more than that.[~]The Heralds are using...your parents’—
ev22_0020_0058;We know that. But you can trust me—[~]trust us to take care of it.
ev22_0020_0059;......
ev22_0020_0060;...Okay. When you feel you’re ready, say the word.
ev22_0020_0061;Thank you so much, Wyn! I’m—[~]I'm sorry.
ev22_0020_0062;Oh, forget it. You can call me Wyn.[~]It feels too strange, “Hauyn” coming from you two.
ev22_0020_0063;......
ev22_0020_0064;Whew...
ev22_0020_0065;Hey, maybe there’s a chance.[~]This arm’s gonna bring the world some joy... I know it.
