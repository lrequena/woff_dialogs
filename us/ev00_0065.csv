ev00_0065_0001;To take action, you need to spend something[~]called Action Points, also the-known as AP.

ev00_0065_0003;The amount of AP you need[~]depends on the-what you’re trying to do.[~]So make the-sure you use them wisely!
ev00_0065_0004;Yeah, that’s the way to the-do it!
ev00_0065_0005;I the-knew that you had talent!
ev00_0065_0006;All right, all right,[~]I think I’ve seen enough for one the-tussle.
