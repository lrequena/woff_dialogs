sub23_010_0000;But you have such a long road ahead of you, no?[~]Why don't you rest a spell at that nice little inn over there!
sub23_010_0001;Oh, um, that’s quite all right, thank you. I’m not tired.[~]And I need to cross the ridge by nightfall.
sub23_010_0002;Ugh, you know what... Rah!
sub23_010_0003;Ugh... S-strength...fading... Oogh.
sub23_010_0004;Oopsie. Now I’ve really gone and zombified the pooch...[~]Well, no one’s gonna blame me for helping young people “go green,” right?
sub23_010_0005;Hey! Any luck drawing in customers?
sub23_010_0006;Oh! M’lady, hello![~]I was [f2]just[/f] about to take this gentleman here to the Solace.
sub23_010_0007;Huh? What’s the matter with him?[~]Looks like he’s already got one foot in the grave.
sub23_010_0008;Oop! Uh, I bet you he’s just hungry, right?[~]You’d better take him back to the inn, on the double!
sub23_010_0009;Hmm, okay. Refia, get this young man set up with a meal.[~]Undead Princess and I are gonna check out that lead.
sub23_010_0010;Sure! Good luck, and watch each other’s backs out there.
sub23_010_0011;So, uh, what exactly is this “lead” we’re chasing?
sub23_010_0012;Oh, there’s been talk of a [f2]really[/f] obnoxious Mirage haunting these parts.
sub23_010_0013;From what I hear, it’s just as irritating as you used to be—[~]which means I need to dispose of it. And you’re helping.
sub23_010_0014;Well, why don’t you tell me how you [f2]really[/f] feel about me.[~]And here I thought you cared. Boo hoo...
sub23_010_0015;Come on, death breath.
sub23_010_0016;Hey! M’lady, wait for me!
sub23_010_0017;So this is the place then? Swaaank! The ground here is nice and damp.[~]You couldn’t ask for better turf to work up a grudge.
sub23_010_0018;Really? I never thought this region[~]would be prime real estate for Mirages like yourself.
sub23_010_0019;Who goes there? Who has come to trespass upon my domain?[~]This land is mine... Begone at once!
