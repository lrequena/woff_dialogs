General_Town_npc_17_A;A friend of mine is part of some kind of anti-Federation resistance movement. Can you believe that? Why would anyone have a problem with the Federation when they do all this great stuff for us?
General_Town_npc_17_B;Back when the Federation was still around, I used to think we could never be happy without them taking care of us. But it turns out that wasn’t the case at all! In fact, I think we’re all happier now than we’ve been in a long time.
