sub43_010_0000;There have just been new sightings of an extremely powerful Mirage.[~]I need for the two of you to take care of it.
sub43_010_0001;Terra is already stationed close by. Once she’s freed up,[~]I’ll tell her to rendezvous with you and help out.
sub43_010_0002;Got it. But there won’t be anything left to help with.[~]One of us is gonna take that Mirage down first.[~]Wanna make it a race, Cloud?
sub43_010_0003;Hmph. Not interested.
sub43_010_0004;There’s a village.[~]Why don’t we ask around about the Mirage? Maybe they’ve seen it.
sub43_010_0005;Hey. Question for you.[~]Have you seen an unusual Mirage in the area?
sub43_010_0006;Oh, you’d better believe that I’ve seen it![~]Ugh, I’ve never been so scared in my life!
sub43_010_0007;When it came here and attacked the village,[~]I was just about ready to give up all hope!
sub43_010_0008;But that’s strange. I don’t see a whole lot of damage.[~]Where did the Mirage go?
sub43_010_0009;You’ll never believe it! This silver-haired swordsman came and drove it off.[~]The way he wielded that long blade of his—it was a sight to behold!
sub43_010_0010;Did you say silver hair?[~]Hey! Tell me where he went!
sub43_010_0011;Cloud. We’re here to look for a Mirage.[~]Not a swordsman. Don’t get sidetracked.
sub43_010_0012;I’m pretty sure that the Mirage retreated to the mountains.[~]The swordsman went the opposite way.
sub43_010_0013;Got it. Thanks a lot.
sub43_010_0014;Cloud?
sub43_010_0015;Sorry, but I’m going after that guy.[~]Take care of the Mirage.
sub43_010_0016;What? Hey! You can’t just leave!
sub43_010_0017;Cloud!
sub43_010_0018;Who is this...swordsman?
sub43_010_0019;[f2]I’ve been waiting too long to pick up his trail.[/f]
sub43_010_0020;[f2]This time...I’ll...[/f]
sub43_010_0021;Cloud! I didn’t expect to find you here.
sub43_010_0022;Terra! Oh, yeah. Quistis mentioned that you were close by.[~]Listen, something else came up.
sub43_010_0023;You should go track down Lightning in case she needs your help.
sub43_010_0024;“Something came up”? You left Lightning to face that Mirage all by herself?![~]What could possibly be so important?!
sub43_010_0025;Look, there’s this guy. I’ve been hunting him for a while.[~]Now I’m finally right on his heels.
sub43_010_0026;I’m not gonna let this chance slip away!
sub43_010_0027;Hunting him? Cloud, you’re scaring me.
sub43_010_0028;Why are you after this person?[~]Did he do something to you?
sub43_010_0029;He took someone away from me. Forever.
sub43_010_0030;So when you find him, what are you going to do?[~]Will killing him bring back the woman that you lost?
sub43_010_0031;......
sub43_010_0032;This isn’t any way to honor her memory.[~]To take your love for her and turn it into hate?[~]Especially when it makes you abandon your friends!
sub43_010_0033;You have to decide. What’s more important?[~]Is it anger and revenge?
sub43_010_0034;All right then. One of us will stick by Lightning.[~]I know what I care about—her safety.
sub43_010_0035;I didn't...
sub43_010_0036;Lightning! You okay?!
sub43_010_0037;Yeah. Thanks. This one’s a real handful.
sub43_010_0038;I bumped into Cloud on my way over,[~]but he said he was busy hunting someone...
sub43_010_0039;It's okay. Just forget about him.[~]Hey! Look out!
sub43_010_0040;Aaah!
sub43_010_0041;Nngh!
sub43_010_0042;Cloud! You came back!
sub43_010_0043;Weren’t you out looking for that silver-haired swordsman?
sub43_010_0044;I remembered I had something more important to do.
sub43_010_0045;Terra. I’m sorry. I get it now...[~]I almost sacrificed others I care about.
sub43_010_0046;Never again. No.[~]I won’t lose anyone else I cherish. I swear.
sub43_010_0047;Oh yeah? So can I take that as official confirmation that you cherish us now?
sub43_010_0048;Yeah. There’s not a thing I [f2]don’t[/f] cherish!
