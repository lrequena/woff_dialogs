ev22_0033_0009;I have decided to hire the two Mirages that have been hanging about the Coliseum of late. They do not seem particularly motivated, but they are quite strong. Perhaps they will put some much-needed zing back into the ring.[~][~]I believe I overheard them mentioning those two children who wandered in... Could that mean they are acquainted?
ev22_0033_0010;Bringing the fire and ice Mirages on board was the right move. I could feel the Coliseum crackling with energy when they faced off against the twins.[~][~]Still, why is it they seem so skittish around Mirages that wield thunder? They are not weak against it, so there must be some other reason. I just hope it doesn’t lead to any trouble...
ev22_0033_0011;That Jiant summoner in the hood is a [f2]babe![/f] But how do I break the ice? What if she likes taller guys? Oh, man...[~][~]Come to think of it, didn’t Quistis say the two of them were going to visit the old Jiant city? Maybe I could tag along and... Ugh, who am I kidding? I don’t know the first thing about fighting. That superpowered Mirage that’s been sighted in the area would fry me to a crisp.
ev22_0033_0012;Hip hip hurray, kupo! Finally, [f2]finally[/f], I’ve found that despicable Mirage that Captain Faris has been searching for all these years, kupo! No more chasing dead ends, kupo. This time Captain Faris will have her vengeance, kupo!
ev22_0033_0013;Did you hear?! Some horrible butcher is on the prowl up in the mountains. He’s been cutting down travelers at random. Can you imagine? You’d better stay at home and keep those doors locked.[~][~]At least the elder has sent for help. Once the League of S gets here, they’ll put that dreadful monster in his place... Won’t they?
ev22_0033_0014;"Don’t tell me you haven’t heard what’s going on around here! A demon has been appearing in Balamb Garden—always at the same hour—and dragging the poor folks he meets into the throes of a nightmare.[~][~]I don’t know how much truth there is in it
