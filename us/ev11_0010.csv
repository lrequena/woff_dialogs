ev11_0010_0001;Hang on a sec.
ev11_0010_0002;Hmm... I don’t see any chain on the place.
ev11_0010_0003;Well, maybe they’re like Cornelia,[~]and they haven’t been annexed[~]by the Federation.
ev11_0010_0004;Huh? It can’t be.
ev11_0010_0005;Hey there, guys! It [f2]is[/f] you, right?
ev11_0010_0006;Hey! Super punchy girl!
ev11_0010_0007;Hi! How are you doing, Tifa?
ev11_0010_0008;It’s the-good to see you!
ev11_0010_0009;Same here!
ev11_0010_0010;Hey, I have to ask.
ev11_0010_0011;What are two Keepers and a Mirage[~]doing way down here in Babil?
ev11_0010_0012;Oh, yeah.[~]I guess we never told you, did we?
ev11_0010_0013;Oh, good! I was starting to worry.
ev11_0010_0014;What if I accidentally saved[~]a couple of bad apples from the Bahamut Army?
ev11_0010_0015;It’s weird. Why does everybody keep thinking[~]that we’re Bahamutian soldiers?
ev11_0010_0016;I don’t know. I guess they don’t[~]see many Mirage Keepers anymore,[~]unless they’re working for the bad guys.
ev11_0010_0018;Yeah... And not just Keepers. Jiants, too.
ev11_0010_0019;These days, they all seem to be fighting for Bahamut.
ev11_0010_0020;I guess it makes sense in a way.[~]They say the Federation conquered their homeland long ago.
ev11_0010_0021;Dude...
ev11_0010_0022;Still, the prophecy’s a hot topic around Nibelheim.[~]Everyone in town has heard of the Jiants from the Hills.
ev11_0010_0023;Ugh... I’m not sure I like being a celebrity.
ev11_0010_0024;Anyway. So you’re looking for the valley of fire?
ev11_0010_0025;Unfortunately, that’s the only real clue that we’ve got.
ev11_0010_0026;The valley of fire... Everyone knows that bit.[~]But no one’s sure which valley is the right one.
ev11_0010_0027;What do you mean?
ev11_0010_0028;If you’re looking for fiery valleys,[~]this region is full of them.
ev11_0010_0029;But that’s just it. Any one of those valleys[~]could be the one the prophecy is talking about.
ev11_0010_0030;Oh, right! I forgot there’s a summoner in town[~]doing research on the valley! She might know.
