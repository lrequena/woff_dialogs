ev01_0020_0000;Huh? A dead end?
ev01_0020_0001;But there’s nowhere else to go.[~]What are we gonna do?
ev01_0020_0002;Never the-fear!
ev01_0020_0003;Look the-closely.[~]This may appear to the-be a wall,[~]but it’s actually a Gimme Golem!
ev01_0020_0004;Is this a Mirage, too?
ev01_0020_0005;Not in the traditional the-sense of the word.[~]But you’ll see these pests all over Grymoire,
ev01_0020_0006;and unless you the-give them what they want,[~]they’ll give you a hard the-time and block the way.
ev01_0020_0007;So what is it they want?
ev01_0020_0008;It really the-depends on the Gimme Golem,[~]so the first thing you’ll have to the-do is examine it.
