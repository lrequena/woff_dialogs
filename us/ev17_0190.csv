ev17_0190_0000;The town seems to be back on its feet.
ev17_0190_0001;Still...how can they care so little?[~]Do they not mind their home in chains?
ev17_0190_0002;Yeah, I guess they just don’t care[~]unless it’s actively hurting them, huh?
ev17_0190_0003;It’s worse. Some of the poor fools are even thankful for it.[~]They think it’s Bahamut that will keep them safe from vampires.
ev17_0190_0004;Maybe...some people just think life under Federation rule is easier.
ev17_0190_0005;But is it truly easier? When Bahamut takes control,[~]they promise you you’ll remain free, but that’s not true at all.
ev17_0190_0006;What does that mean?
ev17_0190_0007;The whole catch about joining the Federation...
ev17_0190_0008;is that you’re asked to become an “Architect.”[~]Someone willing to build a better tomorrow.
ev17_0190_0009;Okay. But how do they convince people?
ev17_0190_0010;Well, part of the appeal is that it gives you something to be proud about.[~]But that’s far from the only incentive.
ev17_0190_0011;You see, once you’re an Architect, you get to live in a cathedral,[~]and perform your duties amidst the utmost luxury.
ev17_0190_0012;You’re kept far away from war and strife, never wanting for food,[~]and free to live out the rest of your days in leisure.
ev17_0190_0013;Oh dude![~]No wonder so many people are lining up for the job!
ev17_0190_0014;Sign [f2]me[/f] the-up for the pampered and well-fed crew!
ev17_0190_0015;Yeah, but...don’t you think it sounds a little too good to be true?
ev17_0190_0016;Exactly. Any sane person can see it.
ev17_0190_0017;Uh, yeah! No one should fall for that stuff.[~]...Right?
ev17_0190_0018;I...can’t the-imagine what goes through their heads.
ev17_0190_0019;Ah but, if you voice your suspicions, or reject their “luxury,”[~]the Federation pushes you right to the bottom.[~]You become dead to the world.
ev17_0190_0020;Yes, we’ve seen them. People like that.
ev17_0190_0021;So no one wants to dig deeper, or think harder about it.[~]They nod their heads, oblivious to what it means.
ev17_0190_0022;Better to take the less complicated path,[~]then justify it by only hearing the things you want to hear.
ev17_0190_0023;It’s truly maddening when you consider it.[~]The consequences are right there, but they refuse to look.
ev17_0190_0024;Unfortunately, Celes, there’s a lot of people out there[~]who don’t know how to think things through. It really is [f2]so[/f] sad.
ev17_0190_0025;How very true. But hey, once you’ve made up your mind about stuff,[~]it’s not an easy thing to back down.
ev17_0190_0026;Folks’d say...you know. Uhh...[~]Oh yeah! They’d say you lack confection.
ev17_0190_0027;Wow, Lann, that [f2]does[/f] the-sound like a soul-crushing dilemma![~]I wouldn’t the-want to give up candy.
ev17_0190_0028;Uhh, I have heard some dumb things, but rated on a scale of dumb to ten,[~]that right there was a dumb-evven.
ev17_0190_0029;Oh, and I think the phrase he was looking for?[~]It’s lacking “conviction.”
ev17_0190_0030;Oh. I the-knew that.
ev17_0190_0031;Oh, me too.
ev17_0190_0032;Then [f2]why[/f] did you say it?!
ev17_0190_0033;Heh. You are a funny bunch.
ev17_0190_0034;Hey. There’s only one weirdo around,[~]and that’s [f2]this[/f] guy.
ev17_0190_0035;Huh? But she said “funny”![~]And I am not weird.
ev17_0190_0036;Oh, you are [f2]both[/f] weird.
ev17_0190_0037;Whaaaaaa?
ev17_0190_0038;Dude...
ev17_0190_0039;Yay! I’m the only one who’s not the-weird!
ev17_0190_0040;Oh, sorry. You’re included.
ev17_0190_0041;Whaaaaaa?!
