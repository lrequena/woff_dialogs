Nibelheim_Quest_npc_01_A_02;Of course! Just as I thought! That restless look in your eye—you’ve journeyed all over the place, correct? I’ve been looking for someone like you. Can you do me a favor?
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_01_A_03;You wouldn’t happen to have any spare bomb fragments on you, would you? Without them, I’m afraid my research here is at a standstill.
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_01_B;Thanks in advance!
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_01_C_01;Wow, you’re a lifesaver! Now I can finally get on with my research!
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_01_C_02;Take this. It’s a little something for your help.
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_01_D;Now that I have those fragments, my research is going swimmingly!
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_01_E;My research is at a standstill...
