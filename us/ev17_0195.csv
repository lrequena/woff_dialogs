ev17_0195_0000;You know, I meant to ask. How did you end up working here with Cid?
ev17_0195_0001;Let’s just say Cid and I go back a long way. He’s the one who hired me to protect Tometown.
ev17_0195_0002;BZEEEK! B-BZEEEEK! BZEEEEK! Bzee...
ev17_0195_0003;Of course, now, I stay for other reasons.
ev17_0195_0004;Hup!
ev17_0195_0005;BOO-GAH!
ev17_0195_0006;Someone has to make sure he stays out of trouble.
ev17_0195_0007;Over half the junk you saw in the Train Graveyard is stuff Cid destroyed on one of his rampages.
ev17_0195_0008;Wow dude. I was wondering how it got piled up. That was [f2]Cid?[/f]
ev17_0195_0009;His mind shuts down, and he becomes a pathological collector who attacks [f2]anything[/f] he sets his sights on.
ev17_0195_0010;There’s no pattern to his targets, so he poses a real danger.
ev17_0195_0011;That sounds pretty rough.
ev17_0195_0012;So you see...someone has to keep an eye on him, or there’s no telling what sort of damage he might do.
