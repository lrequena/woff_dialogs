sub14_010_0000;Huff... Huff...
sub14_010_0001;That’s...how many?
sub14_010_0002;......
sub14_010_0003;Don’t know.[~]After we hit twenty, I stopped counting.
sub14_010_0004;At least...we’re wearing it down.
sub14_010_0005;You can tell yourself that.
sub14_010_0006;It’s exactly as I thought.
sub14_010_0007;I’ve been keeping an eye on its behavioral patterns,[~]and it seems to keep moving between the fire valleys.
sub14_010_0008;Then you were right.[~]It must be drawn to heat sources.
sub14_010_0009;Mm. Luckily. At least we know now[~]that it shouldn’t be coming for Nibelheim anytime soon.
sub14_010_0010;But remember Valley Seven.[~]There’s always a chance one of the fire valleys can go out.
sub14_010_0011;If it does, and that thing’s near Nibelheim,[~]it might take what it can get.
sub14_010_0012;If it’s alive it can die, so let’s hit it till it does.[~]As many times as it takes.
sub14_010_0013;Okay. This’ll be good training!
sub14_010_0014;I’ll help in any way I can.
sub14_010_0015;Right. Let’s go!
