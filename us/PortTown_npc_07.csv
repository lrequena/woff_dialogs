PortTown_npc_07_A_01;Hey, I wouldn’t go that way if I were you.
PortTown_npc_07_A_02;Why not? Well, uh, that’s an excellent question...but I’m afraid I’ve already said too much.

PortTown_npc_07_C_02;I hope Dr. Shantotto can do something about all those mechanical monsters running around...
PortTown_npc_07_D_01;Doctor Shantotto terrifies me to my core, and yet...I just can’t seem to take my eyes off of her.
