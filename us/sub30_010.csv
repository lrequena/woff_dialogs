sub30_010_0000;If Quistis’s information is correct, then it’s almost time.
sub30_010_0001;Balamb Garden has been summoning a demon?
sub30_010_0002;That’s what the reports have been saying.
sub30_010_0003;Do you believe it?
sub30_010_0004;Of course I don’t.
sub30_010_0005;All right, then what do you think this alleged demon really is?
sub30_010_0006;Do you mind looking into it for me?[~]All the sightings so far have been reported to be around the same hour.
sub30_010_0007;Strange. This demon that’s appearing...[~]I wonder what it could be.
sub30_010_0008;Oho... So I’m a demon now.[~]What a fascinating allegation.
sub30_010_0009;Huh?
sub30_010_0010;So, level with me here.[~]What do I look like to you?
sub30_010_0011;To be totally honest...you fit the description.
sub30_010_0012;Ohhh...  A demon then.
sub30_010_0013;Yes. I know who you are.[~]You’re one of the Demon Dyad’s Servants from a century ago—Diabolos.
sub30_010_0014;I’m a what now?![~]...Oh, I see. So Grymoire decided those two were demons.
sub30_010_0015;Huh? But how does them being demons[~]make me a demon too? Their servant!
sub30_010_0016;So then tell me why you would show up now, amidst such chaos?
sub30_010_0017;You [f2]know[/f] why I’ve come.[~]A servant of demons has no purpose but this...
sub30_010_0018;furthering the chaos.
sub30_010_0019;Ugh... Then, I must punish you in the Keepers’ absence.
sub30_010_0020;You would ruin all my fun? Oh, I’m so scared...[~]NOT!
