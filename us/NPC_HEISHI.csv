npc_heishi_0000_0000;Ah! Short time no see.
npc_heishi_0000_0001;Sorry?
npc_heishi_0000_0002;I’m the man you first ran into down in the prison.
npc_heishi_0000_0003;Whoa! You look different.
npc_heishi_0000_0004;We had to fool the Federation—at least long enough to yank ourselves free—and that meant keeping you two in the dark. Sorry about that.
npc_heishi_0000_0005;Eh, we’re mostly over it.
npc_heishi_0000_0006;Well good! That’s a relief! You know, Figaro owes you big time for this. Thank you!
npc_heishi_0001_0000;By the way, is there any chance you two have been to Nibelheim up in the Babil region?
npc_heishi_0001_0001;I only ask, because you do know how Shinra developed the tech to build Nibelheim? By studying Midgar.
npc_heishi_0001_0002;Oh! Actually, I can see that.
npc_heishi_0001_0003;The village of Mist used to sit on that very spot, until the fire valleys caused catastrophic damage in the area.
npc_heishi_0001_0004;But then Shinra stepped in, and built a facility powered by that same fire. I guess that Midgar taught them quite a bit.
npc_heishi_0001_0005;That’s pretty spectacular.
npc_heishi_0001_0006;’Course, I hear that the engineers responsible for it... Well, they’ve all gone missing, as it turns out. What a terrible loss.
npc_heishi_0002_0000;So, how goes the journey?
npc_heishi_0002_0001;Fear not! We can handle things around here.
npc_heishi_0003_0000;Figaro is made of sterner stuff than you may think.
npc_heishi_0003_0001;’Cause out here in the desert, we end up seeing their kind all the time. Yup, it may not seem like it, but we’re plenty used to dealing with them.
