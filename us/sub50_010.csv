sub50_010_0000;Cloud, you back here again?
sub50_010_0001;Yeah. With all of these records here,[~]there may be something on the guy I’m after.
sub50_010_0002;What guy?
sub50_010_0003;Ah! Impeccable timing, Cloud![~]This book has given me a wonderful idea, but I’ll need your help.
sub50_010_0004;What? An opera?!
sub50_010_0005;Not interested.
sub50_010_0006;No way!
sub50_010_0007;Now now, not so fast.[~]Celes, what did you say to me the other day?
sub50_010_0008;Because I can recall you lamenting[~]how gloomy the town has been since that whole vampire ordeal.
sub50_010_0009;I might have said something like that.[~]But how does an opera figure in?
sub50_010_0010;With their little hearts broken like that,[~]they may never enjoy a book again.
sub50_010_0011;Cid... It’s not that tragic.
sub50_010_0012;Hm? It’s not? Take two![~]With their little hearts broken like that,[~]they’ll never find the courage to fend off all the Cogna.
sub50_010_0013;Oh, well, I suppose you’re right about that.
sub50_010_0014;DO YOU SEE?![~]This opera is perfect for un-slumping the town’s spirits!
sub50_010_0015;You don’t expect [f2]us[/f] to...
sub50_010_0016;Yes! It features a mysterious hero and a beautiful heroine![~]Who could be better for the roles?
sub50_010_0017;Back in my younger years,[~]I used to be head over heads for this libretto.
sub50_010_0018;I’m not some opera floozy![~]I refuse to embarrass myself on stage!
sub50_010_0019;Sorry, but you can count me out too.
sub50_010_0020;Oh, don’t [f2]say[/f] that![~]In fact you [f2]can’t[/f] say that because you’re already on the flyers.
sub50_010_0021;So as the saying goes, break a leg!
sub50_010_0022;I oughta break [f2]your [/f]leg for doing that!
sub50_010_0023;Okay, get rehearsing!
sub50_010_0024;What? H-hold it!
sub50_010_0025;So, he knows I’m not doing this?
sub50_010_0026;Ahem...[~]♪ [f2]Ah, ah, ah, aaah[/f]
sub50_010_0027;Is that her?[~]I think Celes is serious. Is she gonna do it?
sub50_010_0028;♪ [f2]O my hero[/f]... Hm? What do you want?[~]A Mirage?!
sub50_010_0029;What’s going on?!
sub50_010_0030;Cloud! This freak fell out of nowhere! Watch it!
sub50_010_0031;Ta-daaa! It’s so quiet in here I could hear an octopus drop![~]You can hardly blame me for wanting to[~]take over the place and save it for my retirement.
sub50_010_0032;I just “flopped” in to see who was making all the noise.[~]Nobody arpeggioes in my new cottagio...[~]unless she happens to be a deliciously pretty lady. Geh heh, geh hee heh!
sub50_010_0033;Who sent you?[~]Was it the Federation?!
sub50_010_0034;Geh heh heh! Nope, never heard of ’em. I’m here to domesticate, not federate![~]And any bozo that gets in my way is gonna get mangled![~]Oh, but the young lady can stay and be my honey pie.
sub50_010_0035;This library is a sacred place![~]No one gave you permission to disturb it!
sub50_010_0036;Well, if you like your sacred library that much, I’d better do you a favor[~]and hide it from anyone unsavory, huh? Here’s a bright idea![~]Maybe I’ll just squirt some ink all over these boooks! Geh heh heh heh!
sub50_010_0037;Keep your tentacles off these books. I need ’em too.[~]If you won’t back off, then I know what’s for dinner.
sub50_010_0038;I’m up for a little fancy cuisine myself!
