ev15_0070_0000;Whoa, what?
ev15_0070_0001;*Cough cough* Hey![~]Who made all this smoke?
ev15_0070_0002;Hm? So it can talk.
ev15_0070_0003;I the-heard it speak too!
ev15_0070_0004;Whoa! A Mirage that can [f2]talk?![/f]
ev15_0070_0005;Hm? So she can.[~]That is odd.
ev15_0070_0006;Heh heh... You [f2]just[/f] noticed?
ev15_0070_0007;So, kid. Your name is Vivi?
ev15_0070_0008;Mm-hm.
ev15_0070_0009;So your friends there—[~]are all of them able to talk just like you do?
ev15_0070_0010;Friends? Where?
ev15_0070_0011;Whoa! It’s a bunch of me’s!
ev15_0070_0012;Wha— Hey!
ev15_0070_0013;Don’t you the-realize they’re dangerous?
ev15_0070_0014;They are?
ev15_0070_0015;Hey! You guys know better[~]than to act mean!
ev15_0070_0016;? ? ?
ev15_0070_0017;See, I knew they’d be reasonable.[~]They even said they’ll help us!
ev15_0070_0018;Whoooa.
ev15_0070_0019;Color me impressed.
ev15_0070_0020;Yes, bravo.
ev15_0070_0021;Okay, so what can me and my friends do for you?
ev15_0070_0022;Oh. Actually...
ev15_0070_0022_1;Whoa! Something’s happening!
ev15_0070_0022_2;Does this mean the reactor’s working?
ev15_0070_0022_3;Figaro Castle can break the-free now!
ev15_0070_0022_4;Oh, hey! We don’t wanna miss this! Come on!
ev15_0070_0022_5;Yeah. Let’s head outside!
ev15_0070_0023;It’s time.[~]Now, full speed ahead!
ev15_0070_0024;Woo-hoo!
ev15_0070_0025;We did it!
ev15_0070_0026;Yeah the-baby!
ev15_0070_0027;Whew... What an ordeal all [f2]that[/f] the-was.
ev15_0070_0028;Yeah, no kidding.
ev15_0070_0029;By the way, couldn’t this be that “cradle of mako’s light”[~]that has the Key of Earth?
ev15_0070_0030;You mean this key here?
ev15_0070_0031;Huh?!
ev15_0070_0032;Dude! It’s the second key![~]Ask and you [f2]shall[/f] receive.
ev15_0070_0033;It appears that Vivi had it all along.
ev15_0070_0034;Lucky the-us!
ev15_0070_0035;[f2]Again, it all seems just a little [/f]too[f2] lucky...[~]But there’s no point in dwelling on it right now.[/f]
ev15_0070_0036;So Vivi, where will you go now?
ev15_0070_0037;Hmm...
ev15_0070_0038;How’s this: stay in Figaro!
ev15_0070_0039;Hey! It’s you!
ev15_0070_0040;Ah, my favorite Jiants.[~]Your help has been most invalua...ble?
ev15_0070_0041;Grrrrrr...
ev15_0070_0042;Grrrrrr...
ev15_0070_0043;Um... Uh... D-didn’t Squall[~]relay my intentions?
ev15_0070_0044;Yes.
ev15_0070_0045;GRRRRRR...
ev15_0070_0046;Well...listen... I-I am sorry.[~]The Federation was watching me like a hawk, so I...
ev15_0070_0047;Ugh... What about Lightning?[~]Is she okay?
ev15_0070_0048;Oh. Yes! I made certain she escaped.
ev15_0070_0049;After all, she wouldn’t have been out there protecting you[~]had I not asked.
ev15_0070_0050;Huh? Seriously?
ev15_0070_0051;She was part of this?
ev15_0070_0052;Oh. Then, technically you [f2]did[/f] help us...[~]before you unhelped us.
ev15_0070_0053;Yeah, I guess...we’re even now?
ev15_0070_0054;Guess so.
ev15_0070_0055;Uh, what was that?
ev15_0070_0056;Where did it come from?
ev15_0070_0057;Has it always been there,[~]lurking beneath Figaro?
ev15_0070_0058;Incredible.[~]That Mirage the-possessed[~]power beyond the-belief.
ev15_0070_0059;Hmm...
ev15_0070_0060;After all that I’ve put you through, this hardly suffices,[~]but I have some information.
ev15_0070_0061;Huh?
ev15_0070_0062;One of the keys is in the “land of naught but night,” correct?[~]Well, I may know where.
ev15_0070_0063;[NOT USED]
ev15_0070_0064;Really?
ev15_0070_0065;Where is it?
ev15_0070_0066;To the west of here, you’ll find Big Bridge:[~]a colossal crossing that will take you to another continent.
ev15_0070_0067;That particular continent gets no sunlight[~]due to the thick, dark skies overhead.
ev15_0070_0068;They even call it the “land of the stolen sun.”[~]Really, how can the place [f2]not[/f] be naught but night?
