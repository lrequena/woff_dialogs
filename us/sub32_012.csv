sub32_012_0000;......!
sub32_012_0001;Ohhh... Missed by a hair.
sub32_012_0002;Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Good.[~]You’re the strongest warrior I’ve crossed swords with in years.
sub32_012_0003;And yet, ’twould be poor form to pursue this now.[~]Find a new blade, and we shall continue this test of our might.
sub32_012_0004;Looks like this won’t be as easy as I thought.
sub32_012_0005;Does he have a weakness...[~]You’re taking on Odin?
sub32_012_0006;Yeah. I heard that you have experience with the Dyad’s Servants.[~]Basically, anything you can tell me would be a big help.
sub32_012_0007;Odin, hmm...[~]Oh, got it! It’s just an old rumor, but...
sub32_012_0008;At last.
sub32_012_0009;You would try me with the same sword that failed you before?
sub32_012_0010;Yeah. Except...[~]I thought I’d mix things up.
sub32_012_0011;Ramewwwl!
sub32_012_0012;Hm? That girl.[~]She looks like Ramuh’s...
sub32_012_0013;It’s his grandkid.
sub32_012_0014;Grandkid!
sub32_012_0015;Hmph. I see you’ve been sniffing about.[~]Is-is this the best you can muster?
sub32_012_0016;Yup.
sub32_012_0017;Ramewl!
sub32_012_0018;Urgh...
sub32_012_0019;What’s wrong?[~]Suddenly you don’t look so hot.
sub32_012_0020;Hmph. Silence![~]Make your peace, before I cleave you in twain.
