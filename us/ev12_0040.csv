ev12_0040_0000;Awww, ha! Look who’s back, baby!
ev12_0040_0001;I guess [f2]you[/f] are.
ev12_0040_0002;You guys seriously just saved my life.[~]Oh, the name’s Snow.
ev12_0040_0003;I came to butt-kick the Big Jiggle lurking in this swamp.
ev12_0040_0004;And then along the way, I saw this awesome golden toad and thought,
ev12_0040_0005;[f2]Man, you don’t see too many of those![/f][~]But who knew? The things are contagious!
ev12_0040_0006;So then, Toad Me was all like,[~][f2]What am I even gonna do?![/f]
ev12_0040_0007;[f2]Could I really eat flies or live on lily pads?[/f] Deep questions.[~]But then you all came along and saved my warts.
ev12_0040_0008;Woo! You guys are the best! For real, bro.
ev12_0040_0009;Dude, I have no idea what’s wrong with you,[~]but as long as you’re happy.
ev12_0040_0010;Did Lann just find someone he can talk the-down to?[~]Never the-thought I’d see the day.
ev12_0040_0011;So, what’s your deal?[~]Where ya from?
ev12_0040_0012;You say you got swept here all the way from Nibelheim?
ev12_0040_0013;Wow. And here I thought I had it pretty rough.
ev12_0040_0014;I mean, Nibelheim, isn’t that one continent up?[~]How are you guys even alive?
ev12_0040_0015;I know, it’s so crazy! I guess...[~]we’re getting kinda pro at it?
ev12_0040_0016;I don’t [f2]want[/f] to be a pro at it...
ev12_0040_0017;Anyway, it seems we’re the-stuck here.[~]All the goop around here makes it[~]the-hard to look for a way out.
ev12_0040_0018;Oh yeah. Well, you’ve got that right.[~]One false step and [f2]whsssht[/f], you’re history.
ev12_0040_0019;Okay, then how did [f2]you[/f] get out here, Snow?
ev12_0040_0020;Heh. Just, like, THIS!
ev12_0040_0021;Whoa! Cool idea!
ev12_0040_0022;Wait a minute.[~]Are you a summoner?!
ev12_0040_0023;Wish I could say I was...but no.
ev12_0040_0024;Sadly, “summoner” is way too[~]fancy a word for what I am.
ev12_0040_0025;Huh?
ev12_0040_0026;But...that’s not important.
ev12_0040_0027;So, what’s the game plan?[~]I don’t mind showing you the way out[~]if that’s what you want.
ev12_0040_0028;How about you? Are you still gonna...[~]“butt-kick the Big Jiggle” or whatever it was?
ev12_0040_0029;You know it![~]It shouldn’t be too far from where we are now.
ev12_0040_0030;So it’s like a Mirage?
ev12_0040_0031;Yup! Me and Jiggles have got some history.
ev12_0040_0032;I gotcha.[~]Then maybe we can help you out.
ev12_0040_0033;Uh, really?
ev12_0040_0034;We’re sort of on a journey to round up Mirages anyway.
ev12_0040_0035;So basically, the more you butt-kick, the more we profit.
ev12_0040_0036;Ahh, I gotcha now. Well, let’s team up then.[~]That stupid Big Jiggle will never know what hit it!
