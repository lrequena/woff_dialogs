ev03_0026_0000;Wait... Is it just me, or can we no longer use the prismariums we set on that device?
ev03_0026_0001;Wuh-oh! I hate to the-say it, but we must have used up all the prismariums’ magic in order to power the contraption.
ev03_0026_0002;Dude! So then what do we do?
ev03_0026_0003;If we go the-back to Nine Wood Hills, or just leave the area, then the prismariums should go back to the-normal. No need to the-worry!
ev03_0026_0004;Whew, that’s a relief.
ev03_0026_0005;Mm, I don’t know, think about it. If we place Mirages on these devices without thinking it through, we’ll be in hot water afterwards in battle.
ev03_0026_0006;Uh...we can always make up for it with courage!
ev03_0026_0007;No, actually we [f2]can’t[/f], so let’s try to plan ahead when deciding which Mirages we use. Got it?
ev03_0026_0008;Aw, c’mon, you know I’m not good at planning.
ev03_0026_0009;I said, [f2]got it?[/f]
ev03_0026_0010;Uh...okay...
