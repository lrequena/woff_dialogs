General_Town_Quest_npc_04_A_01;I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it! Oh, I can’t stand it. Why do those Mirages insist on causing me trouble?
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_A_02;Hmm? You two... You wouldn’t happen to be the Jiants from the Hills, would you? You’ve come at just the right time.
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_A_03;There are some horrible Mirages I want you to reprimand for me.
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_A_04;Those thieving good-for-nothings have raided every single shipment of the luxury tea leaves I ordered! Ooh, it makes me furious just thinking about it!
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_A_05;There you are. I’ve been waiting for you. There’s another batch of Mirages standing between me and my tea. You’ll take care of these for me too, won’t you?
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_B_01;These are the despicable fiends that’ve been stealing my tea leaves!
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_B_02;These are the Mirages I want you to reprimand for me!
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_B_03;These things! These are the Mirages disrupting my afternoon tea!
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_C_01;Be a dear and take care of this for me, won’t you?
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_C_02;I’m sure you’ll be delighted to lend me your assistance, won’t you?
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_C_03;Make them regret the day they ever dared to lay their foul paws on my precious tea!
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_D_01;Hurry up and take care of those Mirages for me!
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_D_02;Get rid of them for me, and I’ll make sure you’re well rewarded.
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_D_03;Take care of this quickly, please. Tea leaves lose their flavor if they sit for too long...
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_E_01;Bravo, bravo! You two are even more competent than I anticipated. Now I can finally enjoy my afternoon tea.
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_E_02;This means that the tea leaves I ordered will finally get here. Splendid!
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_E_03;Ha ha ha ha! This is what happens to those who stand between me and my tea!
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_F_01;Here is the reward I promised. Go on then, you earned it.
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_F_02;This is payment for services rendered. I’ll let you know if I have any more work for you.
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_F_03;Take this, with my gratitude.
General_Town_Quest_npc_04_G;Now there’s nothing stopping me from enjoying a nice hot cup of tea. Thank you. Your help has been invaluable.
