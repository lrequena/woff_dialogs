sub05_015_0000;Grrraaah! Wh-when did [f2]you[/f] little half-pints get here?!
sub05_015_0001;Well, is it Underdog Day or isn’t it?!
sub05_015_0002;If you think you’re stronger,[~]shouldn’t you be ready to prove it?
sub05_015_0003;Ha ha ha ha ha![~]Once you have felt my true wrath, you’ll regret those words!
sub05_015_0004;Why do they call it “Underdog Day” anyway?[~]“Dark Horse Day” would sound a hundred times cooler.
sub05_015_0005;I guess that’s a reasonable question.[~]When did you learn a fancy expression like “dark horse”?
sub05_015_0006;Since we’re in Grymoire,[~]wouldn’t it the-have to be “Dark Chocobo Day”?
sub05_015_0007;Wait. But this is Grymoire,[~]so it would have to be “Dark [f2]Chocobo[/f] Day.”
sub05_015_0008;Ohhh, that’s a great idea! We could blindfold a bunch of chocobos—[~]no, put boxes on their heads—and then we can have them race!
sub05_015_0009;Maybe he doesn’t the-know[~]what “dark horse” means after all.
sub05_015_0010;Ah. And then the chocobos would be in the dark.
sub05_015_0011;Why me...
sub05_015_0012;Poor the-Reynn...
sub05_015_0013;Poor Reynn...
