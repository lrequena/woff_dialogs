ev07_0040_0000;Aw yeah!
ev07_0040_0000_1;Heh heh heh heh...[~]Ha ha ha ha ha!
ev07_0040_0001;How—
ev07_0040_0002;Why are you stopping? Show me more![~]Does fate bind us? Has destiny aligned us?
ev07_0040_0003;Show me!
ev07_0040_0004;Urk!
ev07_0040_0005;Sir Segwarides...[~]Wh-why are you...
ev07_0040_0006;You are a fool![~]To so much as inquire.
ev07_0040_0007;An imbecile beyond belief,[~]to let a Medium to Champion aspire!
ev07_0040_0008;Uh...okay.
ev07_0040_0009;That’s not good...
ev07_0040_0010;[f2]Away[/f] from death, [f2]away[/f] from life they stay![~]Contain them or you'll— Graaah!
ev07_0040_0011;Quick, this way!
ev07_0040_0012;Huh? Isn’t that the same—
ev07_0040_0013;Well, are you guys coming or not?
ev07_0040_0014;Huh?!
ev07_0040_0015;Uh, right!
ev07_0040_0016;O-okay!
ev07_0040_0017;The-run for your lives!
ev07_0040_0018;Heh heh heh. The gods would caution us.[~]Is this a sign that we’ll not go unchallenged?[~]That there’s no way to know the pieces are aligned?
ev07_0040_0019;Heh heh heh, ha ha ha ha ha!
ev07_0040_0020;Whew! That was too close.
ev07_0040_0021;Sherlotta, thank you.
ev07_0040_0022;Huh?
ev07_0040_0023;Huh?
ev07_0040_0024;Huh?
ev07_0040_0025;I just knew you would get yourselves in trouble,[~]and boy did you prove me right.
ev07_0040_0026;Agh! What do you call that creepy trick?
ev07_0040_0027;You’re the creepy one here!
ev07_0040_0028;Unbelievable. Would you just put these on?[~]Then take another look at the town.
ev07_0040_0029;Ah! What the honk...
ev07_0040_0030;Huh? Is that coming out of the sky?
ev07_0040_0031;Let the-me! I wanna have a the-turn!
ev07_0040_0032;Hey! Refia, you should the-have a look too!
ev07_0040_0033;How do you explain this?
ev07_0040_0034;Don’t expect any help from me on that one.
ev07_0040_0035;After all, not even the visitor[~]who left those monocles at my inn[~]could tell me exactly what it’s showing us or how.
ev07_0040_0036;From what I was told, every member state[~]in the Federation is trussed up like this.
ev07_0040_0037;So, I thought I’d bring the lenses here,[~]but maybe I didn’t have to.
ev07_0040_0038;The thane was visibly crazy.[~]What in Grymoire is going on?
ev07_0040_0039;Uh...
ev07_0040_0040;Okay, guess we’ll file that one[~]under “no one knows.”
ev07_0040_0041;So, what do we do?[~]We came here to ask about the League of S,[~]but all we found was a lot more questions.
ev07_0040_0042;Sorry. Did you say the League of S?
ev07_0040_0043;That’s right.
ev07_0040_0044;Oh! If that’s all it is, then maybe I can help you out.
ev07_0040_0045;You can?!
ev07_0040_0046;Oh, sure. I know a few people right here in Saronia[~]who should be able to get in touch with the League.[~]I’ll ask them to pass on your message.
ev07_0040_0047;Do you mean it? Thank you!
ev07_0040_0048;Sherlotta’s been around a lot longer than she looks,[~]so she knows tons of people. Isn’t that great?
ev07_0040_0049;Don’t you talk about my age.
ev07_0040_0050;Eh heh heh...
ev07_0040_0051;So like, what’s with you and the cat-o-morphosis?
ev07_0040_0052;That...is a very long story that I don’t feel like telling.
ev07_0040_0053;But, I will say this.
ev07_0040_0053_1;Cats get around.
ev07_0040_0054;Huh?
ev07_0040_0055;Yup.
ev07_0040_0056;Oh. Uh, that’s cool.
ev07_0040_0057;Yup.
ev07_0040_0058;So! The real question is,[~]what are you two planning to bite off next?
ev07_0040_0059;We’ve still got a lot to puzzle over.[~]But now that the League of S thing is settled,
ev07_0040_0060;I think we’d better resume our quest to find Mirages.
ev07_0040_0061;Yeah.
ev07_0040_0062;Plus we’ve got that castle and Mom[~]to track down along the way, too.
ev07_0040_0063;Sounds pretty good to me.
ev07_0040_0064;From here, the best place to go next[~]would have to be the Low Seas.
ev07_0040_0065;In which case, you basically have no choice[~]but to find a boat down at the docks.
ev07_0040_0066;I guess this [f2]is[/f] the last town on the continent.[~]Okay then. We’ll figure something out.
ev07_0040_0067;So what about you two?
ev07_0040_0068;Are you coming back to the Solace, Refia?
ev07_0040_0069;The wolves have been taken care of now,[~]so the only thing to fight off is the cold.
ev07_0040_0070;Sure. I need some time to digest this business with Uncle Takka.[~]The Solace sounds great...if you’ll have me.
ev07_0040_0071;Of course I will.
ev07_0040_0072;Well you two, thank you so much for everything.[~]Best of luck in all your adventures.
ev07_0040_0073;Thanks! Take care!
ev07_0040_0074;Hey Sherlotta, thanks for stepping in to help.
ev07_0040_0075;Sure!
ev07_0040_0076;Speaking of stepping in...[~]I don’t suppose you were planning to make it up to me?[~]For trouncing on my tail?
ev07_0040_0078;Oh! So, that really [f2]was[/f] you![~]Gosh, I was kinda hoping you'd forget...
