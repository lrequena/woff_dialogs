ev03_0050_0000;Enough. I have seen my fill for one day.
ev03_0050_0001;That was fun, for what it was.
ev03_0050_0002;A shame the two of you[~]have so much growing up to do.
ev03_0050_0003;Quiet, you! I’m a hulk waiting to happen.
ev03_0050_0004;So long. We shall meet again.
ev03_0050_0005;Bye-bye for now.
ev03_0050_0006;Well, our paths may cross before you know it.
ev03_0050_0007;The Mirages of the Nebula have been set free...
ev03_0050_0008;And once again, time resumes its march.
ev03_0050_0009;Well, we’d better make our way back to Cornelia,[~]before the Bahamutians get any funny ideas.
ev03_0050_0010;We gotta go all the way back?
ev03_0050_0011;You can head to Nine Wood Hills[~]right the-now if you want to!
ev03_0050_0012;Huh?
ev03_0050_0013;Now that the boss has been the-bested,[~]I can make you an Exit Gate right the-here and now!
ev03_0050_0014;It’ll take you the-back to Nine Wood Hills,[~]and from there Cornelia’s easy.
ev03_0050_0015;Thanks to the buzzcut! I remember.
ev03_0050_0016;You don’t get shortcuts[~]much the-shorter than a buzzcut!
ev03_0050_0017;Wait! Unless you buzz the buzzcut,[~]and then the-what’ve you got?!
ev03_0050_0018;Uh, I think at that point, you call it a “bald-cut.”
ev03_0050_0019a;NOT USED
ev03_0050_0020;Huh? What’s this?
ev03_0050_0021;A prismarium! Duuuuuuh.
ev03_0050_0022;I know it’s a prismarium, dummy.
ev03_0050_0023;You didn’t manage to imprism those tough Mirages,[~]but it looks the-like they gave you this prismarium[~]from the same tribe as a consolation prize.
ev03_0050_0024;I see. I guess we made the grade, then.
ev03_0050_0025;Boop! Ta-the-da!
