Nibelheim_Quest_npc_03_A_01;Excuse me. I’m sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if I could ask you a favor.
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_03_A_02;You see, my grandson’s birthday is coming up soon, and I was hoping to give him some dragon scales.
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_03_A_03;Is there any chance you would be willing to bring me some? I’d be very grateful if you could...
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_03_B;You would? Oh, thank you... That’s very kind of you.
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_03_C;I see... I suppose I’ll have to find something else to give him then...
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_03_D;Oh, have you changed your mind?
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_03_E;Sorry to make you go to so much trouble, but I’d be very grateful if you could bring me some dragon scales.
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_03_F_01;Oh, thank you! My grandson’s going to be thrilled when he opens his present!
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_03_F_02;I know it’s not much, but I hope you’ll accept this as a reward.
