PortTown_npc_05_A_01;What’s that? You’d like to know more about the Sunken Temple? Oh, I’m so sorry, but I’m afraid there just isn’t much I can tell you.
PortTown_npc_05_A_02;I’ve met all sorts of visitors here during my lifetime, but you’re the first to ever ask me about the Sunken Temple right off the bat.
PortTown_npc_05_B_01;The folks who aren’t from around here always remark on how those of us from Besaid are so laid-back and easygoing.
PortTown_npc_05_B_02;But if you ask me, they’re just too wound up.
PortTown_npc_05_C_01;What do you think’s going to become of us what with all those weird machines running around? Oh, let me tell you, I am so scared.
PortTown_npc_05_C_02;I know I may seem as steady as a rock, but inside I’m all aflutter.
PortTown_npc_05_D_01;Now that things are peaceful again, we’ve been seeing more visitors than ever before.
PortTown_npc_05_D_02;Did I ever tell you how much I love to hear other people’s adventure stories? I do hope you’ll tell me some the next time you drop by.
