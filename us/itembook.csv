Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_01;21st of Versichrom, Mythril V[~][~]Daddy got me my own diary (that’s you, the thing I’m writing in). He said my brother’s is just going to collect dust, so I need to be a good big sister and write enough for the both of us. Well, my brother may be a lazy doofus, but don’t worry, Diary. I’LL make sure to give you lots of attention.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_02;3rd of Lazulith, Mythril V[~][~]Mommy had to work again today. Well, it’s no wonder everyone counts on her, Diary. She’s SO strong! Unfortunately, though, that means she’s too busy to play with us, which means my brother is always in a whiny mood.[~][~]But honestly, sometimes even I wish a little that she would quit her (stupid) job...
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_03_01;11th of Adamanse, Mythril VI[~][~]Mommy collapsed on her way out the door when she went to work.[~][~]We called the doctor, who said it was just a cold. Mommy laughed it off, but she looked like she was suffering. Not to mention she was running a high fever.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_03_02;I’m happy when Mommy stays home with us, but not if it means she has to be sick.[~][~]Get well soon, Mommy, and then we can play.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_04;6th of Granate, Mythril IX[~][~]Once again, Mom went to work first thing in the morning and still hasn’t come home. Today was her birthday, so the two of us were planning to make her dinner... So much for that.[~][~]Isn’t there anything we can do to help her work less hard?
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_05;"22nd of Lazulith, Mythril XI[~][~]One of the neighborhood kids teased us about our arms today. I’d forgotten how it felt
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_06;19th of Amethys, Mythril XIII[~][~]I asked Dad if there was anything we could do to help Mom out. But he just laughed and said we were already being a big help by chipping in with the housework. Doesn’t he get that I want Mom to work less?
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_07;5th of Granate, Mythril XV[~][~]My brother and I have decided to try imprisming some of Mom’s Mirages.[~][~]Today, we targeted one of the weaker ones, and I can’t believe how easy it was to get it! I think we’re going to keep rolling with this and round up as many as we can. This is the best way to take a load off Mom’s shoulders.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_08;14th of Achatea, Mythril XV[~][~]The seven Mirages in the Pleiad are so, so cool. It’s not just that they’re strong—and they really, really are. Each of them is so DIFFERENT, and they don’t let anyone tell them how to live. (I guess Ramuh’s the closest to actually being responsible?)[~][~]Anyway, my brother and I have been hanging with them and having a grand old time, but the other day Dad let us have it. He said we have to start “toning things down.” What’s that supposed to mean? As long as they all do what we tell them, I don’t see the problem.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_09_01;25th of Achatea, Mythril XV[~][~]I cannot believe MY DAD. How can he be so clueless? We’re working our butts off so Mom doesn’t have to and he DOES NOT GET IT AT ALL.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_09_02;He keeps telling us that gathering up the Mirages is “causing everyone problems.” Oh yeah? Well, once we’re good enough at this that we can handle Mom’s job, she’ll finally be able to take it easy. You’d think he would start caring about her, not “everyone.”
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_10_01;20th of Lazulith, Mythril XV[~][~]Wyn told me and my brother about some kind of gods from another world who are supposed to be crazy powerful. The three of us talked about them for a while—how gods that powerful could probably make all the world’s problems go away.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_10_02;If we could just find some way to bring them here, I know they could make Mom’s life easier. I bet even those folks Dad says we’re bothering would be pleased.[~][~]...You know what? I’m going to start working on this with my brother right away. We’ll do it as soon as we’re ready.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_11_01;16th of Adulary, Mythril XVI[~][~]It didn’t work? Was summoning them the wrong idea? I’ve never seen anything like them... What ARE they?[~][~]I was expecting gods—gods that would come to our world and make everything easier...
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_11_02;And now Mom and Dad are... Why?[~][~]Where did we go wrong? What are we supposed to do now? Is there anyone who can save us? Wyn? Mom? Dad?
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_12_01;17th of Adulary, Mythril XVI[~][~]My brother and I talked it over. We don’t know how we got here, and we don’t know where things will take us from here.[~][~]But we can agree on one thing...
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_12_02;[~][~]We have to save them. We have to save Mom and Dad.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_13_01;19th of Adulary, Mythril XVI[~][~]It’s no use... They’re too powerful—especially that first one that came through. He’s every bit as formidable as the legend said.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_13_02;The other two, the ones that took Mom and Dad, have been stripping us of our Mirages and setting them free... All our hopes are slipping away.[~][~]If they manage to loose the Mirages of the Pleiad on the world...
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_14_01;[~][~]No, no, no, no, no... NO. It can’t happen.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_14_02;22nd of Adulary, Mythril XVI[~][~]I don’t understand... Are Mom and Dad angry with us? Of course they are, it’s the only reason they would do such a horrible thing...[~][~]But why? Unless... Unless they’re not Mom and Dad anymore...
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_14_03;[~][~][~]They’re coming for us...[~]I don’t know why.[~]But we have to run.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_15_01;30th of Adulary, Mythril XVI[~][~][f2]DETECTED: Subject is unable to manually add to log. Subject will be labeled “1a” and partial autologging enabled.[~][~]The souls of 1a’s immediate family remain intact, although only barely. During the struggle and failure by these subjects (hereafter “2” and “3”) to fight back, a barrier was created using weapons of 3’s making and sealed by four beasts. This barrier was used to imprison subject “4” in a twisted, inner world of 2’s choosing: one resistant to physical and magical attempts at escape.[/f]
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_15_02;[f2]Subsequently, 2 externalized and activated 3’s powers in an attempt to create another world, one that would provide refuge for 1a and her brother (hereafter “1b”) from the forces eroding their souls.[~][~]At this time, it can be inferred that 3 was still, in no small part, a conscious participant. However, his powers were used incorrectly, producing a number of disharmonies that resulted in a misshapen, isolated microcosm plagued by a daunting problem.[/f]
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_15_03;[f2]Helpless, 1a and 1b were then transported to that world. A lone god was present to bear witness to 2 and 3’s final wish. However, this god merely watched and listened, unwilling to intervene.[/f]
Nigiyakashi_Item_Diary_15_04;[f2]Now that their memories have been unceremoniously spliced away, 1a and 1b will most certainly enter a sleep, wherein they pretend at broken lives within their broken world. Never will they recall the events logged herein...[~][~]Partial logging will end here pursuant to 1a’s expungement from G.[/f]
Nigiyakashi_Item_Record_01_01;"Investigation into the Heralds / Report No. ---[~][~]At the time of this report, there are, to our knowledge, only three so-called “Heralds”: the king of Bahamut, Brandelis
Nigiyakashi_Item_Record_01_02;"We finally have an answer to the long-standing question of how their army is able to mobilize Mirages in such large numbers
Nigiyakashi_Item_Record_02_01;Investigation into the Heralds / Report No. ---[~][~]It has been widely acknowledged that the Heralds do not appear to age, and we can safely treat this as fact. Though the three of them were supposedly summoned to Grymoire a century ago, to date, we have uncovered no evidence of any senescent changes.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Record_02_02;As for why they do not age, we will need to investigate further and bring the true nature of their beings to light.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Occult_01_01;To kick off this issue, we’ll be tackling the mysterious “light bubble” sightings in Pyreglow Forest. Occult Fan decided to set foot into the shady glades ourselves to determine whether or not [f2]this[/f] rumor needed its bubble burst.[~][~]As we clambered through the dense wood, we noticed our surroundings getting darker and darker. Before long, we were completely, hopelessly lost![~][~]But just when it seemed like every path was a dead end and home a distant prospect...we saw them, out of nowhere!
Nigiyakashi_Item_Occult_01_02;A number of luminous bubbles drifted through the air like a constellation. The stories were true! We paused a moment to take in this otherworldly scene. But then my traveling companion Wedge pointed out something even more remarkable.[~][~]“Chief, is it just me, or are those lights trying to lead us somewhere?”
Nigiyakashi_Item_Occult_01_03;Doggone it, he was right! The bubbles seemed to be flowing in a single direction.[~][~]Realizing we had stumbled onto something quite significant, we decided to press further into the forest to confront whatever new mysteries lay ahead. (Reporting by Biggs)
Nigiyakashi_Item_Occult_02_01;Today we’ll be looking at the so-called treasure ship whose phantomlike appearances have been causing bedlam in the port town of Saronia.[~][~]Occult Fan has obtained exclusive info revealing the ship is decked out in jewels—and speaking of decks, this galleon’s gangways are said to be overflowing with treasure.[~][~]Well, there was only one way to find out if this fairy tale was full of fairy fail, and so we shoved off in search of the truth. But here was the funny thing: a local fisherman claimed no one had ever seen the ship out on the water.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Occult_02_02;“Then where was it seen?” we asked incisively. Well, here’s the scoop.[~][~]Whenever the treasure ship needs repairs or improvements, it docks at a dungeon-like harbor. Everyone who has seen it has reported hearing “chimes.” Some have tried forcing an encounter by ringing a series of bells, but to this the ship does not respond.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Occult_02_03;After thanking the fisherman for his revelatory contribution, we decided to get our quachos in a row. What had we learned?[~][~]First, there was a clear connection between the chimes and the ship’s appearance. But random bell-ringing wasn’t cutting it. And speaking of cutting, that was when my traveling companion Wedge cut in.[~][~]“Maybe you have to ring them in the right order?” Great goblins, what if he was right! That would explain why the ship hadn’t come. No one knew the right order.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Occult_02_04;If the person chiming the ship home lives somewhere in Saronia, then it is possible the port town is hiding some kind of vital clue. We resumed our investigation with new vigor. (Reporting by Biggs)
Nigiyakashi_Item_Occult_03_01;Many of our readers will have visited the Phantom Sands. This famous desert seems to offer the same scenery in succession no matter which way you go. But have you heard the rumors that proceeding correctly will take you to an oasis?[~][~]Well, the desert may have sand, but so do we here at Occult Fan. We decided to head to the scene and sift through the story ourselves.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Occult_03_02;On we trudged amidst sweltering heat. But sure enough, soon one dune was starting to look very similar to the next. We couldn’t shake the feeling that we were going in circles. It was my traveling companion Wedge who broke the awkward silence.[~][~]“Chief, I see some kind of bright light coming from up ahead.” I turned and saw he had crossed to the opposite cliff. Light, he said? How strange. I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary on my side.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Occult_03_03;The sharp rock faces around me blocked out the sun. But Wedge insisted he could see [f2]something[/f]. Are you thinking what I was thinking, readers?[~][~]Excitedly, I crossed to where Wedge was standing, dreaming of oasises, or oases, or whatever plural of oasis might await us. (Reporting by Biggs)
Nigiyakashi_Item_Occult_04_01;In this issue, we’ll be documenting our strangest (but still very true!) encounter in the Phantom Sands.[~][~]Readers might recall our miserable meanderings through the desert from our last issue. Having finally reached the oasis, we reveled in its beauty for a spell before making the decision to turn back before nightfall.[~][~]It was during our return trip that it happened. My traveling companion Wedge lost his footing, and when I moved to catch him we both tumbled to the bottom of the cliff, where a gaping hole swallowed us up like some terrible maw. I braced for the end.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Occult_04_02;But when I came to my senses, I was lying on soft sand. The area around me was dark, with only a faint light spilling in from the hole we left far above us.[~][~]Miraculously uninjured, I got Wedge to his feet, and we surveyed our surroundings. Ahead, we spotted a single treasure chest.[~][~]Now, this was no time to be getting giddy over treasure, of course, but I realized the chest might contain some vital implement that could extricate us from our situation. I stepped toward it.
Nigiyakashi_Item_Occult_04_03;“Wait, Chief! You should think this through!”[~][~]I heard Wedge try to stop me. But what other leads did we have? All the same, I could feel it too: something felt off. I tried to shake my doubts as I reached toward the chest... (Reporting by Biggs)
