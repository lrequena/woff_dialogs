ev12_0030_0000;Ribbit! Ribby ra-rib! Ribba-ribbit!
ev12_0030_0000_1;Eep?!
ev12_0030_0001;What’s with this toad?
ev12_0030_0002;Is it a Mirage? ’Cause it doesn’t act like one.
ev12_0030_0003;Ribbit! Ribbit. Ribbity ribbity ribbit!
ev12_0030_0004;Ribbit? Ribbity-ribbit? The-rib?
ev12_0030_0005;Ribbit? Ribbit! Ribba ribba ribbit.
ev12_0030_0006;Ribbee! The-bib.
ev12_0030_0007;What? You speak toadese?
ev12_0030_0008;Of the-course I do.[~]Listen, you can tell from his accent[~]that he’s been the-toad-cursed.
ev12_0030_0009;He’s a GUY?
ev12_0030_0010;They have [f2]accents?[/f]
ev12_0030_0011;Obvious-the-ly.
ev12_0030_0012;Ribbit? Ribbity the-ribbity tib? The-bibbit?
ev12_0030_0013;Ribbit! Ribbi-rit. Ribbit!
ev12_0030_0014;What’d he say?
ev12_0030_0015;From what I gather, it sounds the-like that golden toad over there[~]is the ’phibian that put the curse on him.
ev12_0030_0016;Oh, so all we have to do is defeat it.
ev12_0030_0017;That’s the-correct.[~]First off, you need to the-imprism it the same as always.
ev12_0030_0018;Okay. We got this.
ev12_0030_0019;Careful [f2]you[/f] don’t get toad-cursed.
ev12_0030_0020;Huh? You mean you’re not coming?
ev12_0030_0021;Well, it’s game over if we [f2]both[/f] go full toad, right?
ev12_0030_0022;Uh...right.
ev12_0030_0023;Don’t let your guard down just ’cause we’re stronger.
ev12_0030_0024;Could that one be rare?
ev12_0030_0025;Do your thing!
