npc_yuna_0000_0000;Hello there.
npc_yuna_0000_0001;The weather is lovely today.
npc_yuna_0000_0002;I don’t know why, but Rydia and Eiko insisted that I stay here in Besaid.
npc_yuna_0000_0003;Even Terra’s in on it now. What are they up to?
npc_yuna_0000_0004;If you ever need help from a summoner, all you have to do is let me know.
npc_yuna_0000_0005;I wonder if I’ll see Tidus again today.
npc_yuna_0000_0006;Ha ha. Lately, it seems like everyone is trying to get me to rest.
npc_yuna_0001_0000;To get to Saronia, you will need to pass through a frigid place called Icicle Ridge.
npc_yuna_0001_0001;If you have Mirages who can use fire magic, you may find your passage considerably easier.
