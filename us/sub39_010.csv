sub39_010_0000;I thought the Cogna were on a rampage in this town.[~]I know that I heard right.
sub39_010_0001;But I don’t see any sign of them.
sub39_010_0002;What’s this?
sub39_010_0003;Ami, you’re doing a brave thing. It’ll be over soon.[~]Can we count on you?
sub39_010_0004;Yes. I promise to see it through to the end.
sub39_010_0005;Pardon... This young lady here—[~]Ami isn't planning to go out there and take on the Cogna?
sub39_010_0006;Huh? Oh...[~]Well, uh...
sub39_010_0007;It’s not like that.[~]Let me explain what’s going on. Miss, um...
sub39_010_0008;Oh, uh... Yuna will be fine.
sub39_010_0009;Those mechanical monsters—they’re called Cogna and they’re dangerous.[~]How do you hope to stand against them?
sub39_010_0010;Don’t go out there.[~]The League of S has better fighters.
sub39_010_0011;The point isn’t for me to fight it.[~]My job is just...to lead it away.
sub39_010_0012;What?
sub39_010_0013;Those Cogna or whatever you call them—[~]trying to fight them would be foolish, we know that.
sub39_010_0014;But if we don’t act,[~]it’s only a matter of time before they take control of the town.
sub39_010_0015;So you see, we came up with a rule here.[~]We take turns, and each household has to send out a decoy.
sub39_010_0016;As long as they’re focused on somebody else,[~]the Cogna will stay away from the town.[~]And now it’s my turn. I’m going.
sub39_010_0017;But that’s...[~]Ami, once they spot you—
sub39_010_0018;You don’t have to tell me what I already know.[~]Several others have gone out there before me.[~]As you may have guessed, none of them ever made it home.
sub39_010_0019;No! I won’t let you do this![~]Let’s contact the League of S for help! Then we can—
sub39_010_0020;You’re welcome to call for all the help that you want.[~]But I’ve made up my mind. I’m doing my part.
sub39_010_0021;While you wait for the League to get here,[~]someone still has to slow those things down.
sub39_010_0022;How can you say that?[~]You’re willing to sacrifice your life?
sub39_010_0023;Well, it’s only one life, right?[~]If that buys some hope for the rest of the town, then so be it.[~]Even a little hope is preferable to no hope at all.
sub39_010_0024;And besides, now that my turn has come up,[~]I can’t say, “Oh, never mind.”
sub39_010_0025;Listen. This is my decision to make and I’ve made it.[~]So please, try and understand.
sub39_010_0026;......
sub39_010_0027;Hey um, Yuna, right? Do you mind if I ask you one small favor?[~]It’s my mother. I was hoping that you could...say good-bye for me.
sub39_010_0028;I’d do it myself, but...I don’t want to lose my courage.[~]Tell her I love her.
sub39_010_0029;She said that? My sweet Ami...[~]Lady Yuna, thank you for delivering the message.
sub39_010_0030;Ma’am... Are you sure about this?[~]Because, you’ll never...
sub39_010_0031;When was I ever able to make her choices for her?[~]...It’s not like I’ll be far behind her.
sub39_010_0032;Stop that. I'm sorry, but this isn’t right![~]This...this can’t be the solution!
sub39_010_0033;Ami thinks she’s giving you hope,[~]but her dying will only take more of your hope away!
sub39_010_0034;It doesn’t make any sense at all!
sub39_010_0035;Don’t think that I don’t know that.[~]I’ve been screaming it in the back of my head from the moment she left.[~]But...she’s so stubborn sometimes. And I couldn’t...
sub39_010_0036;Lady Yuna, please! Please save my daughter![~]I can’t keep pretending this is okay. It’s not!
sub39_010_0037;Don’t worry. I will bring Ami home!
