ev17_0165_0000;Oh! Looks like everyone is back to normal now.
ev17_0165_0001;Another day has been the-saved!
ev17_0165_0002;Alrighty then, next up is... What were we after again?
ev17_0165_0003;The Key of Tides.
ev17_0165_0004;“Will Reynn and the-Lann succeed in their noble adventure? Stay the-tuned!”
ev17_0165_0005;Tama! Hey! Who gave you permission to cut to a commercial break? Put us back on the air!
ev17_0165_0006;“And now...back to the Adventures of Lann and Reynn and Tama and a Bunch of Mirages and Lann!”
ev17_0165_0007;Oh, whatever... So what are we doing? Anybody? Should we go pay one last visit to Celes and Cid before we head out?
