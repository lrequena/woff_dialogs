MoveDesertCastle_npc_01_A_01;Hey, it’s you two! I want to apologize again about everything we put you through.
MoveDesertCastle_npc_01_A_02;But you pulled it off. We’d never have escaped the Federation’s grasp without you.
MoveDesertCastle_npc_01_B_01;The Cogna have started targeting us, too. But not to worry.
MoveDesertCastle_npc_01_B_02;We’ve got King Edgar [f2]and[/f] the Black Mages on our side. We’ll be fine.
MoveDesertCastle_npc_01_B_03;You two just focus on what it is you need to do.
MoveDesertCastle_npc_01_C_01;The Federation is no more! Three cheers for the Jiants from the Hills! ...Hm?
MoveDesertCastle_npc_01_C_02;“The Jiants from the Hills”? I’ve never heard of anyone like that before...
