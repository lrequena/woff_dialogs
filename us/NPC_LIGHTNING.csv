npc_lightning_0000_0000;Something I can help you with?
npc_lightning_0000_0001;Sorry, but I’m kind of busy right now.
npc_lightning_0000_0002;No god out there has any right to decide what direction our future should take.
npc_lightning_0000_0003;Hold on to your dreams. Keep them alive.
npc_lightning_0000_0004;Nothing is set in stone. If you decide to challenge fate, I’ll be right there with you.
npc_lightning_0000_0005;I’ll tell you this. Getting picked to do a god’s dirty work isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.
