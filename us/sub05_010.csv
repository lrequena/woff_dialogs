sub05_010_0000;All right, you scoundrels.[~]Do you all remember what day it is?
sub05_010_0001;It’s Underdog Day, kupo!
sub05_010_0002;Aye! When any pirate can challenge his betters.
sub05_010_0003;Only the strongest can captain us![~]Do any of you have the pom-poms to dispute me?
sub05_010_0004;Heh heh heh.[~]Today is the day you answer to Cap’n Mog, kupo!
sub05_010_0005;Oh, well aren’t you full of fire.[~]So what have you got for me this time?
sub05_010_0006;I’ve seized a most ancient, forbidden spell, kupo.[~]Cap’n, you’re sharkbait, kupooo!
sub05_010_0007;Kupo kupo ku-po...[~]Kuuu-POOO!
sub05_010_0008;Hm? That’s it?
sub05_010_0009;Kupo? That’s strange, kupo...[~]Oh! It was “ku-po-POOO” and not— KU-POOOOOO?!
sub05_010_0010;Rrraaah! Wha— Who’s there?[~]Which of you wretched fools summoned me away?
sub05_010_0011;Ku-kupo? It was a summoning spell, kupo?!
sub05_010_0012;Don’t you “kupo” me. Fool![~]You didn’t know what it was?
sub05_010_0013;So [f2]you’re[/f] the one?[~]You dragged me to this place?!
sub05_010_0014;J-just hear me out for one second, kupo!
sub05_010_0015;Ohhh... “Underdog Day,” is it?[~]Sounds like my kind of diversion. Very well...
sub05_010_0016;I shall be your opponent, human one! This ship of yours, all of you—[~]soon you will bow down before Ifrit as your master!
sub05_010_0017;But, but that isn’t [f2]fair[/f], kupo![~]If it wasn’t for me, you would be—
sub05_010_0018;Grrraaah! Only the strongest can lead this pathetic crew.[~]Now, we begin!
sub05_010_0019;Ha! As you wish.[~]Come on, you animal!
