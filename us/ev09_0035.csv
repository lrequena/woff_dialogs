ev09_0030_0019;Well, at least it’s starting to warm up.
ev09_0030_0020;Oh yeah. The breeze is really nice.
ev09_0030_0021;I can’t the-believe they loaned us this great boat! We really lucked the-out this time.
ev09_0030_0022;Dude, I know, right? We don’t even have to steer it. I love the easy life.
ev09_0030_0023;But Lann...
ev09_0030_0024;Hm?
ev09_0030_0025;Aren’t you just a little worried about what Faris and Quistis said?
ev09_0030_0026;What did they say?
ev09_0030_0027;Now that you mention it, they did kind of make it the-sound like we weren’t gonna live out the day.
ev09_0030_0028;Pretty much.
ev09_0030_0029;Wonder why.
ev09_0030_0030;Hmm... What’s so bad about the Low Seas?
ev09_0030_0031;We’re just going south...right? You know, somewhere lower down on the map or something?
ev09_0030_0032;What if they’re called “low”...because of all the lowlifes living the-there?
ev09_0030_0033;That could be it.
ev09_0030_0034;Hey, uh, Reynn?
ev09_0030_0035;Huh?
ev09_0030_0036;Is it just me, or is the river getting more whooshy?
ev09_0030_0037;Y-you think so?
ev09_0030_0038;Reynn, all of a sudden, I am suddenly getting this really bad sudden feeling.
ev09_0030_0039;Yeah, me too.
ev09_0030_0040;Bad feeling? About the-what?
