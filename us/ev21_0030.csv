ev21_0030_0001;That’s a problem. We can’t be in all of those places at once.
ev21_0030_0002;Tiiime...I command you to [f2]stop![/f] Okay, can we just build a time machine or something?

ev21_0030_0006;Oh! Wait. That girl behind the door in Nine Wood Hills—couldn’t [f2]she[/f] help us reach everyone?
ev21_0030_0007;You’re right! Inside her room, we can skip around to any point in time that we want!
