sub16_010_0000;That mosquito brings me no end of woe.
sub16_010_0001;I agree that that thing’s buzz is super annoying,[~]but it’s also really dangerous.
sub16_010_0002;Right. We’ve been lucky, but some towns have suffered great damage,[~]thanks to the explosives that Cogna drops from the air.
sub16_010_0003;Explosives, you say?[~]And how are they made?
sub16_010_0004;Well, they don’t seem to be the same as real bombs.[~]I’ve heard they’re more like some sort of magical charge.
sub16_010_0005;A new kind of magic, eh?[~]You don’t say...
sub16_010_0006;You there, the jock with the gills of a flounder.

sub16_010_0013;You mean blitzball!
sub16_010_0014;Yes...that.[~]Knock it out of the sky, and bring it back here.
sub16_010_0015;I’ll be waiting over in my laboratory.[~]Now—chop-chop, my dear!
sub16_010_0016;Uh...yes ma’am!
sub16_010_0017;Uh, listen...[~]Is there anything I can do to help?
sub16_010_0018;That’d be awesome. Thank you.
