ev21_add_05_0000;Tama, do you know anything else about those three Heralds?
ev21_add_05_0001;Nothing the-firsthand.
ev21_add_05_0002;The Exnine Knights are the-like an army.
ev21_add_05_0003;They have the-lots of members, so it’s no the-wonder I haven’t met the three here in Grymoire.
ev21_add_05_0004;There’s that many of them? Dude!
ev21_add_05_0005;Not only that, the ones with names and the-numbers are the cruelest and most dangerous of all.
ev21_add_05_0006;Each is responsible for the-destroying many of Enna Kros’s the-worlds.
ev21_add_05_0007;Didn’t the Champions rise up to stop them?
ev21_add_05_0008;Of course they the-tried. Without the Champions, the whole googolplex of worlds would have the-fallen.
ev21_add_05_0009;But, wait. Don’t all three of the Heralds have names?
ev21_add_05_0010;They sure the-do. We’ve the-heard them call each other by those names. I’ve never the-seen three of them in one place before.
ev21_add_05_0011;Well, don’t worry. We have the Champions and a whole host of Mirages to help us protect Grymoire.
ev21_add_05_0012;Right. So c’mon! Let’s get this done!
