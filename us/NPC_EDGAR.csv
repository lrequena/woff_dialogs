npc_edger_0000_0000;Sorry, I’m a little tied up right now.
npc_edger_0000_0001;Don’t worry. Between the soldiers and Vivi’s gang, Figaro will be fine.
npc_edger_0000_0002;Now then, what to tackle next...
npc_edger_0000_0003;Reynn! How good of you to come. Please, make yourself at home.
npc_edger_0000_0004;Hm? Oh, Lann. I didn’t see you there.
npc_edger_0000_0005;You say you’re a lady too, Tama? My sincerest apologies. Can I take you to dinner sometime to make it up to you?
npc_edger_0001_0000;As for the sandstorm to the west, moving the castle appears to have taken all the spite out of it.
npc_edger_0001_0001;But once you reach Big Bridge, beware of a strange man with a rather dramatic disposition.
npc_edger_0001_0002;He has been attacking travelers. And worse.
npc_edger_0001_0003;You missed the League agents. They had to leave for their next mission.
npc_edger_0001_0004;Busy as a pack of cactuars.
