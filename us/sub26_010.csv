sub26_010_0000;So it’s been that long...
sub26_010_0001;None of us know exactly how long it’s been...
sub26_010_0002;but it’s estimated the Jiants who lived here[~]must have disappeared about a hundred years ago.
sub26_010_0003;A century...[~]It’s a little hard to imagine.
sub26_010_0004;Well, why don’t we head back to the airship and—
sub26_010_0005;Rrraaahhh!
sub26_010_0006;Wh-what the...
sub26_010_0007;Rrraaahhh!!!
sub26_010_0008;......!
sub26_010_0009;Was there something I could help you with, Bahamut?[~]Oh, or should I call you Tiababylo?
sub26_010_0010;Huh? You dare speak my true name before a stranger?[~]Have you lost your [f2]mind?![/f]
sub26_010_0011;Uh, what is going on?
sub26_010_0012;It’s been a century, you said? Been quite a while...[~]But I used to know old Bahamut here.
sub26_010_0013;You...[f2]know[/f] the Dyad’s Servant?
sub26_010_0014;A servant? Me?
sub26_010_0015;Heh...haha! Sorry.[~]She means that you once served Lann and Reynn.
sub26_010_0016;Ah, yes. Who can forget [f2]those[/f] two.
sub26_010_0017;What?! Lann and Reynn are...[~]the Demon Dyad?!
sub26_010_0018;The Heralds—probably Segwarides—[~]must have concocted the name to spice up their “Crimson Prophecy.”
sub26_010_0019;But, there’s a basis to it. The original Azure Prophecy mentions demons too.[~]...Did Lann and Reynn know? Could they have read it?
sub26_010_0020;Reynn always was an avid reader.
sub26_010_0021;Yes, she was...[~]Except, acting out prophecies sounds like Lann.
sub26_010_0022;You know, you’re kind of[~]taking all the wonder out of my childhood here.
sub26_010_0023;One thing I know—[~]no one would’ve started calling them the “Demon Dyad” or whatever—
sub26_010_0024;if [f2]you[/f] hadn’t been there acting like demons[~]and wreaking havoc against their will.
sub26_010_0025;Hah! You can blame the “Heralds” for that!
sub26_010_0026;I don’t care how long I was sealed away.[~]How dare Brandelis name his army “Bahamut,”
sub26_010_0027;and declare himself king of this world?! I’ll kill him![~]Tell me where he is right this instant!
sub26_010_0028;Is [f2]that[/f] the reason you’re here?[~]Listen, I’ve observed Brandelis up close for a century, and...
sub26_010_0029;Tiababylo... Face it.[~]You don’t stand the slightest chance against him.
sub26_010_0030;What was that?!
sub26_010_0031;The Exnine Knights—I trust you’ve heard of them.
sub26_010_0032;They’re a fusion of three things: an esper like me, a human, and lastly a god from the Extraverse. Correct?
sub26_010_0033;Gods from the “Extraverse”? “Espers”?[~]What are those?
sub26_010_0034;Well, the Azure Prophecy makes mention of them both.[~]Essentially, it says—
sub26_010_0035;From oblivion, light and dark were born. Light begat beings called espers.[~]Dark begat monsters, and humans who sought the light.
sub26_010_0036;In the Extraverse, the world that surrounds ours,[~]live gods that feed solely on death and destruction.[~]Gods—that are beings and non-beings—and will not heed reason.
sub26_010_0037;One world found a tear in the fabric,[~]and exploited it to confine espers inside their human bodies.[~]However, this tear left them open to the Extraverse, and its cruel gods.
sub26_010_0038;So then does that mean the Heralds...[~]are those exact same gods?
sub26_010_0039;I can’t say anything with real certainty yet.
sub26_010_0040;In the end, the prophecy is just words.[~]So the best we can do, is venture a guess at what it means.
sub26_010_0041;In fact, it’s because this first section was so ambiguous[~]it was omitted from copies. Only direct descendants know it.
sub26_010_0042;Then...that would make [f2]you[/f]...
sub26_010_0043;Yes. That’s right. The First Summoner’s descendant.[~]Oh, and probably the last Jiant summoner, I would imagine.
sub26_010_0044;Although, it seems that some of you[~]have picked up the art of summoning in our place. You’ll keep it alive.
sub26_010_0045;Enough! Get to the point.[~]Are you saying that Brandelis has become an Exnine Knight?
sub26_010_0046;Yes, that’s right. A being, who just like in the prophecy, has crossed dimensions.[~]In a way, what else can you call him but a god?
sub26_010_0047;He’s completely different from the Brandelis that you think you know.[~]You can’t beat him. You can’t even touch him.
sub26_010_0048;GRRRAAAHHH!
sub26_010_0049;This cannot be! What you say is impossible!
sub26_010_0050;It doesn’t matter what Brandelis is like now! He’s not me![~][f2]I’m[/f] the true king! The [f2]Bahamut[/f] King! Tia—Tiababylo the Great!
sub26_010_0051;Ugh... Great.[~]I see your temper’s as short as ever.
sub26_010_0052;(READYING her staff)
sub26_010_0053;Keeaaaaaah!
sub26_010_0054;Wh-why are we [f2]fighting?[/f]
