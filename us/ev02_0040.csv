ev02_0040_0000;Wow... This place rules!
ev02_0040_0001;Yeah, it’s like something right out of a fantasy.
ev02_0040_0002;Hey, Tama. Why don’t you hitch a ride?
ev02_0040_0003;Roger the-dodger!
ev02_0040_0004;Pardon.
ev02_0040_0005;If I may ask, would you be kind enough[~]to tell me what country you hail from?
ev02_0040_0006;Oh, us? We’re, uh...
ev02_0040_0007;Ah! Mirages from the Bahamutian Army!
ev02_0040_0008;Baha-moo? What’s...a Bahamoo?
ev02_0040_0009;Well, the Bahamutian Federation[~]has a whole army of Mirages in their employ.
ev02_0040_0010;Huh? Someone’s made a whole army out of them?
ev02_0040_0011;Sounds just fine by me.[~]Line ’em up nice and neat for us, so we can round ’em up!
