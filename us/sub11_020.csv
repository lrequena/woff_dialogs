sub11_020_0000;Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow![~]Okay, okay! Just lay off of me!
sub11_020_0001;Wooow! You’re the strongest mortals I’ve ever seen.[~]I don’t suppose such tough gals would be willing to— Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
sub11_020_0002;Hey-yah!
sub11_020_0003;Eeyaaah!
sub11_020_0004;Do you think she was trying to tell us something there?
sub11_020_0005;Maybe. As long as she’s not bothering [f2]this[/f] place anymore.[~]Let’s go home.
sub11_020_0006;Stop right theeere!
sub11_020_0007;Are you just naturally mean?
sub11_020_0008;’Cause I was all like “Don’t kill me, let’s talk!”[~]Don’t pretend you didn’t hear me.
sub11_020_0009;Was I supposed to spare you so you’d stab me in the back?[~]And why are you still breathing? Can’t you take a hint?
sub11_020_0010;Let’s try this again.
sub11_020_0011;Aaah! I am [f2]so[/f] not breathing![~]Check it out! Dead as a doornail—oh, I’m [f2]un[/f]-dead!
sub11_020_0012;The problem is, I can’t let creepy she-monsters scare folks away from my inn[~]because that would basically put me out of business. ...Hrah!
sub11_020_0013;Waaah!
sub11_020_0014;Shall we, Refia?
sub11_020_0015;Uh, remind me never to get on your naughty list.
sub11_020_0016;Look who you can’t kill!
sub11_020_0017;What is it going to take?
sub11_020_0018;Sherlotta, I don’t think we’re going to make much progress this way.[~]Maybe we should hear what she has to say.
sub11_020_0019;You’re [f2]way[/f] too nice for your own good.[~]Now talk. And it better be worth it if you don’t want a beating.
sub11_020_0020;Why are you so violent?!
sub11_020_0021;Look, just for the record,[~]I’m not doing this ’cause it was my choice.
sub11_020_0022;Come [f2]on[/f]... Being a Mirage leaves me with sooo much time to kill.[~]So I said fine, what the hey, may as well make a little bling-bling off my hobby.
sub11_020_0023;So you’re tormenting people just because you’re [f2]bored?[/f]
sub11_020_0024;Aaah! Please don’t hurt me! I’m just trying to give you some context.[~]If m’lady has a better idea, then hey, I’m all ears!
sub11_020_0025;So what you’re saying...is you don’t know [f2]what[/f] to do with your un-life.
sub11_020_0026;Yeah. Super lame, I know.
sub11_020_0027;I mean, all I’ve really got is this deep-seated grudge—[~]which is great for my hex life—but sometimes the magic[~]just isn’t there even though it’s supposed to be.
sub11_020_0028;Ugh. All right, I get it.[~]If I can’t slay you, I may as well make you useful.
sub11_020_0029;Whoa! For real?!
sub11_020_0030;From now on, instead of scaring adventurers [f2]away[/f] from my inn,[~]I want you to scare them [f2]towards[/f] it. If you can do that, you’re hired.
sub11_020_0031;Coool! You really mean it?[~]Yes! I’ll do it! I’m on the job!
sub11_020_0032;And [f2]don’t[/f] you go threatening them or stealing their valuables.
sub11_020_0033;Oh, I would never dream of it, mistress! Oooh![~]I have a purpose! Something to live for at long last!
sub11_020_0034;You just got through telling us you’re dead.
sub11_020_0035;Well, that should take care of that.[~]Refia, we’re leaving.
sub11_020_0036;Oh, right!
sub11_020_0037;Hey! Wait, mistress! I’m going with you!
sub11_020_0038;Nope, your job is right here, 24/7.
sub11_020_0039;Wha? Is that, like, even legal?
