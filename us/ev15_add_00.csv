ev15_add_00_0000;There’s something strange about these Mirages...
ev15_add_00_0001;I think some of them are unimprismable unless you use eldboxes like the one Squall the-gave you.
ev15_add_00_0002;Huh? Say that again?
ev15_add_00_0003;You mean they’re machines, not Mirages?
ev15_add_00_0004;Maybe machines, or the-maybe...
ev15_add_00_0005;No, that’s the-impossible. Never the-mind, forget I said it!
ev15_add_00_0006;Okay! It’s forgotten!
ev15_add_00_0007;...Well, at least we know how to imprism them. For now.
