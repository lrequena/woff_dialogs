EV00_DETAILED_TEXT_00;A young boy awakens with a start. It’s almost time for work! He throws off his covers and hurries out of the house toward the small café he part-times at.
EV00_DETAILED_TEXT_01_00;[~]The boy is shocked to find that he is the first one to arrive at work that morning. A customer is already seated, lounging absentmindedly at a table near the back. After serving her a cup of coffee, the boy kicks back and relaxes...[~][~]...only to have his peaceful morning shattered when his sister Reynn bursts through the door. She drags him outside, pointing out (quite forcefully!) that something is wrong. Why isn’t there a single person walking the streets?![~][~]The customer, one Enna Kros, steps out of the café and introduces a little fox named Tama. Together, they begin to explain to Reynn and Lann just what is going on.
EV00_DETAILED_TEXT_01_01;Reynn and Lann possess a special power. They are Mirage Keepers, people endowed with the ability to control creatures known as Mirages. Their powers were once so great that they could have reigned supreme over the world. However, their Mirages, along with any memories connected to those Mirages, have been stripped away.[~][~]But there is light at the end of this tunnel. If Reynn and Lann can recover their Mirages, they may just regain their memories—and perhaps even meet their family.[~][~]Guided by Enna Kros, and with Tama in tow, the two set out on an adventure to a new world: Grymoire, the land of Mirages!
EV01_DETAILED_TEXT_00;Reynn and Lann arrive in Grymoire to discover they look very, very different. They have been transformed, and can now take the same form as the residents of this strange new world. They immediately set out to collect Mirages and recover their lost memories.
EV01_DETAILED_TEXT_01;[~]Things were all going well and fine as the twins explored the bright green landscape of an otherworldly forest. That is, of course, until they set foot into a strange crack in reality known as a murkrift.[~][~]The twins, confronted by a powerful enemy they could not hope to defeat, are soon at death’s door...only to be rescued by the noble Tama, who sacrifices one of her many lives to rewind time and return them to Nine Wood Hills.[~][~]There, they run once again into Enna Kros, who informs them of a visitor to their empty world. Perhaps they should go meet her?
EV01_DETAILED_TEXT_02;In the shopping district, the twins meet a cheerful young woman by the name of Chocolatte. Somewhat overwhelmed by her aggressive salesmanship, the two agree to stop by her establishment whenever they need to do some shopping.
EV01_DETAILED_TEXT_03;[~]As Reynn and Lann prepare to return to Grymoire and resume their quest to collect Mirages, Tama bumps into an old friend, the wind pixie Serafie.[~][~]Serafie has been tasked by Enna Kros with helping the twins manage their prismarium collection. After a brief chat, Reynn and Lann continue on to the Gate.
EV01_DETAILED_TEXT_04;[~]Enna Kros is waiting for Reynn and Lann back in Sylver Park. She tells them it is time for her to bid Nine Wood Hills farewell. The twins protest her sudden departure, but faced with their barrage of questions, Enna Kros merely smiles. As she disappears in a flash of light, she tells them who she is: god.[~][~]Reynn and Lann are certainly shaken by this strange turn of events, but for now, they have little choice but to resume their quest. They return to Grymoire, and begin looking for a way out of the woods.
EV02_DETAILED_TEXT_00;On the other side of the forest is a vast plain dotted with lakes that sparkle in the sun. Reynn and Lann take a minute to drink in the beauty of the world that awaits them before once again setting forth into the unknown.
EV02_DETAILED_TEXT_01_00;[~]Further along, the twins hear the sound of a whistle slice through the air as an oddly shaped train pulls up to the nearby station.[~][~]Reynn and Lann hop aboard, where they are greeted by the gregarious Mirage who operates the train, the Cactuar Conductor. Once the matter of tickets is settled, the train sets off.[~][~]Ahead of them looms a wondrous sight: the city of Cornelia, a town that appears to have been built upwards by piling building upon building in a stack that reaches into the sky.
EV02_DETAILED_TEXT_01_01;"Reynn and Lann stroll through Cornelia, taking in the sights and the sounds of the city. But the peace is soon broken by panicked screams. A host of Mirages have attacked the city, soldiers in the employ of the “Bahamutian Army.”[~][~]But who they are is neither here nor there
EV02_DETAILED_TEXT_02_00;[~]Reynn and Lann enter the throne room of Castle Cornelia, only to find that the woman they met in town is none other than Cornelia’s ruler, Princess Sarah![~][~]A good ruler is always gracious, and Princess Sarah thanks the twins for saving her city. Then she gets down to business.[~][~]She tells the twins that they are, without a doubt, the “Jiants from the Hills” spoken of in prophecy. They are destined to alter the course of Grymoirian history, bringing it either salvation...or ruin.
EV02_DETAILED_TEXT_02_01;Reynn begins to ponder the implications of the prophecy, but there are more pressing concerns at hand. The Bahamutian Army will soon be at Cornelia’s gates, and the twins have agreed to help turn them back. But first, they head to the Nether Nebula to capture more Mirages. After all, they won’t be much help to anyone until they get more firepower on their side.
EV03_DETAILED_TEXT_00_00;Deep within the heart of the Nether Nebula, Reynn and Lann encounter Ifrit, Shiva, and Ramuh. These powerful Mirages seem to have some sort of history with the twins...
EV03_DETAILED_TEXT_00_01;To prove their strength, the twins agree to do battle with one of these three Mirages, and emerge victorious. But they still lack the power to command such powerful Mirages in battle. Instead, their chosen opponent leaves them a lesser prismarium belonging to its tribe and disappears to parts unknown.[~][~]Reynn and Lann return to Cornelia to face the Bahamutian Army.
EV04_DETAILED_TEXT_00;Having returned to Cornelia, Reynn and Lann discover that the Bahamutian Army has set up camp near the city.[~][~]Lann comes up with a courageous plan to cut the head off of the beast. The twins head into the Watchplains, behind enemy lines, where they hope to circle around the main force and strike at the Bahamutian commander from behind.
EV04_DETAILED_TEXT_01_00;[~]Lann and Reynn find Princess Sarah bravely leading her troops in the thick of battle.[~][~]The princess shoots them a wry smile, but it is quickly overshadowed by a giant goblin that has risen from the cliffs behind her. Just as it brings its fist down to crush her, the brigade captain gallantly leaps to her rescue, saving her just in the nick of time. But there is no time for celebration, for the goblin looms over them, readying its next strike...
EV04_DETAILED_TEXT_01_01;Just as all hope seems lost, the brigade captain’s body glows with a strange light. At that moment, he is awakened as one of Cornelia’s legendary heroes: a Warrior of Light! Reynn and Lann hurry to his aid, and together they rout the remaining Bahamutian troops.[~][~]Removing the enemy leader’s helmet, they are shocked to find that it is not a Jiant as they expected, but a Mirage. Unsure of what this could mean, the twins return to Cornelia.[~][~]Meanwhile, dark forces have begun to shift in the shadows. The time they have awaited has finally come...
EV05_DETAILED_TEXT_00;With the Bahamutian Army defeated, peace has returned to the kingdom of Cornelia. However, they must remain vigilant. Another attack could come at any moment. To shore up Cornelia’s defenses, Princess Sarah proposes they make contact with the anti-Federation organization known as the League of S.[~][~]Seeing as they’ve already come this far, and could use some sort of direction as they round up new Mirages, Reynn and Lann offer to act as Princess Sarah’s emissaries.[~][~]With her letter in hand, they depart for the northern country of Saronia, whose thane is rumored to be in contact with the League.
EV05_DETAILED_TEXT_01;[~]Along the way, Reynn and Lann enter a mystical wood known as Pyreglow Forest.
EV05_DETAILED_TEXT_02_00;[~]By a lake in the heart of the wood, Reynn and Lann meet the summoner Yuna.[~][~]Yuna mistakes the twins for the Bahamutian Army’s “Heralds” and attacks. Soon, however, she realizes the power they hold resembles that of the great Lusse Farna, and so she asks the twins who they are.[~][~]Reynn and Lann recall that their mother’s name was also Lusse Farna, and beg Yuna to tell them everything she knows of her. Yuna agrees to share what little has survived in legend.
EV05_DETAILED_TEXT_02_01;[f2]A hundred years ago, Grymoire was on the brink of destruction at the hands of the Demon Dyad. When all seemed lost, a hero stepped forth: Lady Lusse Farna. Summoning three Heralds from another world, she stopped the Demon Dyad. But soon after her victory, she disappeared, and none have seen her since. The Heralds she summoned, however, remained in Grymoire and founded the Bahamutian Federation. Soon, their influence spread across the world...[/f][~][~]Lann grows impatient, failing to see how a story from a hundred years ago could have any connection to their mother. Reynn, ever the sensible one, reminds him that their memories are vague and unreliable.[~][~]Yuna reveals that Saronia has recently joined the Federation. Although this puts a damper on their plans, the twins decide to continue on with the slim hope Saronia and its thane can shed some light on the League of S.
EV06_DETAILED_TEXT_00;A vast snowscape of silver and white awaits Reynn and Lann on the far side of Pyreglow Forest. Huddling against the cold, they hurry to a nearby inn.
EV06_DETAILED_TEXT_01_00;[~]Once inside, Reynn and Lann meet the proprietor: a young lady named Sherlotta who seems wise and experienced beyond her age.
EV06_DETAILED_TEXT_01_01;The twins look for something to ward off the elements while treating themselves to a well-earned rest.
EV06_DETAILED_TEXT_02;[~]Sherlotta gives the twins the warlock’s warmer, a magical item that can protect them from the harsh cold. Accompanied by their new friend Refia, they set out for Saronia.
EV06_DETAILED_TEXT_03;[~]The party enters Icicle Ridge, the gaping valley that stands between them and Saronia. They search for an exit while keeping a watchful eye out for the dangerous Mirages said to haunt the ridge.
EV06_DETAILED_TEXT_04;Harried by attacks from a pack of white nakks, the party decides to put an end to this game of nakk and mouse by taking down the pack’s leader. They give chase, only to find themselves outwitted by the creature.[~][~]After barely managing to subdue the pack of angry beasts that surrounded them, the party eagerly bids the ridge farewell.
EV07_DETAILED_TEXT_00;With Icicle Ridge behind them, the party finally arrives in Saronia. The twins part ways with Refia, and prepare to meet with the thane. Along the way, they decide to gather some information from the locals.
EV07_DETAILED_TEXT_01;[~]Reynn and Lann learn from the townsfolk that a great social and economic divide has appeared between those who accept the Federation, and those who do not. Although Saronia’s annexation to the Federation was recent, the difference between these two classes of people is already readily apparent.[~][~]Somewhat disturbed by what they have seen, Reynn and Lann nevertheless continue on to see the thane.
EV07_DETAILED_TEXT_02_00;"[~]At the entrance to the thane’s manor, the twins find Refia arguing heatedly with the guards. They have refused to allow her to visit the thane, her own uncle. The twins present Princess Sarah’s letter and manage to escort Refia past the protesting guards.[~][~]Their audience with the thane takes a sour turn when they realize Refia’s uncle has been replaced by some sort of Bahamutian soldier in disguise. Although the three manage to defeat this false thane, he quickly rises as if immortal. What happens next shocks them all the more
EV07_DETAILED_TEXT_02_01;The lenses reveal a colossal anchor driven straight into the heart of Saronia. Attached to the anchor is a vast chain that rises into the distant heavens. Sherlotta explains that every town and city the Federation has annexed is bound by these invisible chains.[~][~]In all the confusion, Reynn and Lann have forgotten to gather any information on the League of S. But they cheer up when Sherlotta tells them that she has a friend who can get in touch with the League. Having left the rest of the diplomacy in Sherlotta’s capable hands, Reynn and Lann resume their Mirage-collecting journey. Their next destination: the Low Seas!
EV08_DETAILED_TEXT_00;Reynn and Lann decide to ask around town for someone willing to lend them a boat and help them reach the Low Seas.
EV08_DETAILED_TEXT_01;[~]Alas, no one is able to help. Realizing they cannot get a boat through legal channels, the twins consider skirting the law a bit. Rumor has it there is a pirate ship at the docks. It’s not stealing if it’s from a pirate, right?
EV08_DETAILED_TEXT_02_00;[~]After making their way through the perilous docks, Reynn and Lann manage to find the pirate ship they’re after. They sneak on board to “borrow” it, but run afoul of its moogle crew and the fiery-eyed Captain Faris.
EV08_DETAILED_TEXT_02_01;The twins have failed to gain the upper hand, and to make matters worse, Saronia’s thane has caught up with them. Things are looking grim, but the twins’ bacon is saved when Faris and Syldra send the thane packing with a powerful strike.[~][~]Reynn and Lann explain to Faris the events that led them here, and in return Faris and her kupirate crew offer up some juicy info. According to the prophecy, the Jiants from the Hills are destined to find four keys and ascend the Crystal Tower. One of these keys lies at the bottom of a valley of fire, on a continent bordering the Low Seas.[~][~]Now that Reynn and Lann know for sure they must go there, they ask Faris for any help she can provide.
EV09_DETAILED_TEXT_00;Faris introduces the twins to Quistis, who has traveled to Saronia to “donate” a ship to the thane. The thane’s monstrous turn is enough to convince Quistis to donate the ship to Reynn and Lann instead.
EV09_DETAILED_TEXT_01;[~]Reynn and Lann hop aboard their new fastcraft and set off downriver toward the Low Seas. At first, the miles meander by pleasantly, but as the current picks up and the far-off roar of water draws closer, they realize they are in trouble.[~][~]Over the towering waterfall they go, as their boat plummets for what feels like a terrifying eternity...[~][~]Reynn, Lann, and Tama find themselves washed up on a rocky shore, their boat beyond hope of repair. They soggily set out in search of some other mode of transportation.
EV09_DETAILED_TEXT_02_00;[~]The twins find a small turtle being picked on by some mean Mirages, and rush to the rescue.[~][~]After driving off its tormenters, they release the turtle back into the sea. Moments later, a gargantuan adamantoise rises from the briny depths. It seems the little turtle had a big friend...
EV09_DETAILED_TEXT_02_01;To thank Reynn and Lann for rescuing his kin, the adamantoise offers to ferry them across the Low Seas. The twins graciously accept his offer, climb onto his shell, and begin their search for Babil.
EV09_DETAILED_TEXT_03_00;[~]The twins were minding their own business when all of a sudden a young woman burst out of the ocean and clambered aboard the adamantoise. She tells them that her name is Rikku, and she’s a treasure hunter.
EV09_DETAILED_TEXT_03_01;Rikku takes a breather from what has been a long swim, and joins the group on their journey to Babil.
EV10_DETAILED_TEXT_00;The adamantoise safely deposits Reynn and Lann on Babil’s Rainbow Shore, and he and Rikku bid the duo farewell.[~][~]Reynn and Lann need information on this valley of fire they’re looking for, and so they head off in search of a town.
EV10_DETAILED_TEXT_01;[~]Beyond the Rainbow Shore lies a rocky, precipitous, and altogether hostile ravine. Keeping an eye out for dangerous Mirages, the twins travel through this stony scar, hoping to find a town on the other side.
EV10_DETAILED_TEXT_02;[~]Waiting for them in the ravine is not one, but [f2]two[/f] great big hungry dragons. Taken by surprise, it looks like they are about to become lunch...[~][~]Just in the nick of time, a young woman wielding the power of a Champion leaps to their rescue. Her name is Tifa.
EV10_DETAILED_TEXT_03;After she leaves, Reynn and Lann travel north to the town of Nibelheim.
EV11_DETAILED_TEXT_00;Reynn and Lann reunite with Tifa in Nibelheim. When she learns that the twins are the Jiants from the Hills spoken of in prophecy, and that they are looking for the keys, she offers to introduce them to a summoner who is researching the valleys where one of the keys may be hidden.
EV11_DETAILED_TEXT_01;"[~]Tifa introduces Reynn and Lann to the summoner Rydia. The twins are startled to learn that there are, in fact, [f2]two[/f] prophecies: the original Azure Prophecy written by the First Summoner
EV11_DETAILED_TEXT_02;[~]The party arrives at Valley Seven, a violent maelstrom of orange flame. The air is choking, dense with the sweltering heat, but Lann and Reynn remain undeterred. They continue deeper into the valley, searching for the key of prophecy.
EV11_DETAILED_TEXT_03;[~]A wall of fire blocks the party’s path. Rydia lets out a shriek of terror and dashes off. Surprised by this strange and sudden outburst, Reynn and Lann set off in pursuit.
EV11_DETAILED_TEXT_04;[~]The twins catch up to Rydia just in time to save her from some Mirages. Rydia confesses that she has a paralyzing fear of flame, but Reynn and Lann, ever their silly selves, manage to cheer her up and calm her down.[~][~]The twins insist she not push herself, and so she agrees to return to Nibelheim once her work here is done.
EV11_DETAILED_TEXT_05;Cloaked in the light of a Champion, Rydia extinguishes the blazing wall that has been blocking their path. Her strength spent, Rydia retreats to Nibelheim.[~][~]Meanwhile, the twins head deeper into the valley, searching for the key.
EV11_DETAILED_TEXT_06_00;[~]In the heart of Valley Seven, the twins find the glowing key. But as they reach out to claim it, a king bomb bursts onto the scene, swallowing their prize whole!
EV11_DETAILED_TEXT_06_01;"The twins battle with the king bomb and emerge victorious. But there is no time to celebrate their victory
EV12_DETAILED_TEXT_00;"Reynn and Lann again find themselves all washed up—this time, on the shores of a vast swamp. First things first
EV12_DETAILED_TEXT_01_00;[~]The twins don’t have to travel far before they encounter a strange toad.
EV12_DETAILED_TEXT_01_01;But the toad is no toad at all. It’s a person: the victim of a toad-curse, it seems. In order to thwart this wartification, they must find and capture a golden toad, and force it to undo the curse.[~][~]Reynn and Lann have never turned down an amphibian in need before, and they don’t plan on starting now.
EV12_DETAILED_TEXT_02;Lann captures the lucky toad, and with it the twins revert Snow back to his human form.[~][~]Snow was originally on his way to lay down the hurt on a Mirage living here in the swamp. The twins agree to help “butt-kick the Big Jiggle,” and off they go into the muck.
EV12_DETAILED_TEXT_03;[~]The party manages to find its target. A giant, gelatinous, quivering ball of golden flan rises out of the swamp, and the battle is met in earnest. After a good number of thumps and thwacks, the flan decides it’s had enough. The party has won...for today, anyway.[~][~]Snow guides the twins through the swamp, freezing them a path over the wetter places. Once they reach relatively drier ground, Snow says his good-byes and races off.
EV13_DETAILED_TEXT_00;Soon the wetlands give way to desert: a vast, vast expanse of it that stretches far out over the horizon. Taking Tama’s sage advice, Reynn and Lann stop by a nearby caravan to “take the-five.”
EV13_DETAILED_TEXT_01;[~]The twins meet a kind merchant who gives them some sunblock to help them beat the heat.[~][~]Reynn and Lann plan their next move, and decide to continue the search for keys or any Mirages that might be around for the taking.

After somehow managing to fend them off, they think that they’re safe...just as another sand worm bursts out of the ground.[~][~]The hapless pair are frozen in surprise as the deadly adversary hurtles toward them. Luckily, Lightning leaps to their aid

EV13_DETAILED_TEXT_03_00;"[~]As they rest, Reynn and Lann regale Lightning with the story of their journey thus far. A passing merchant overhears them and joins the conversation.

EV13_DETAILED_TEXT_03_01;The drinks they had last night were spiced with more than cinnamon, and the twins find themselves barely able to stand. A woman appears in plumed armor and casts some sort of spell on the two.[~][~]When the twins try to fight back, an unbearable pain lances through their arms, and they lose consciousness.
EV14_DETAILED_TEXT_00;Reynn and Lann wake to a quiet, grey darkness. They are in some sort of ruins. Although both of them appear to be unharmed, the pain in their arms has not abated. Grimacing, they take a look around.
EV14_DETAILED_TEXT_01;[~]A ragged man crouches dejectedly in the corner of the room. He tells them they have been taken to a prison, and that all who try to escape are hunted down by deadly, sentient machines.

Without Mirages, their chances of fighting it off are paper-thin...[~][~]Suddenly, a figure leaps out of the darkness, finishing off the Magitek armor in the twinkling of an eye. The young man turns and introduces himself to the twins. His name is Squall.
EV14_DETAILED_TEXT_02_01;Squall gives the twins an eldbox, an item that allows them to capture machines the same way as Mirages. Adding the Magitek armor to their collection, Reynn and Lann follow Squall deeper into the underground prison.
EV14_DETAILED_TEXT_03_00;[~]Squall explains he is on a mission to dislodge the anchor chaining Figaro Castle to the Federation. If they can activate Mako Reactor 0, which lies somewhere in this underground facility, it might provide just enough horsepower to yank free of the chain.[~][~]There is one little hiccup, though: the surrounding area is crawling with Mirages. Figaro’s king, Edgar, feigned allegiance to the Federation to sneak Reynn and Lann into the prison to deal with exactly this problem.
EV14_DETAILED_TEXT_03_01;"The party finds itself cornered by another Magitek armor patrol. Squall shouts at Reynn and Lann to go on without him while he keeps the enemy at bay

Unable to match her skill in battle, the twins have no choice but to try to summon their Mirages. The pain is paralyzing, and yet the suppressors hold... Their attacker, Shelke, uses some kind of strange power just as the two pass out.

To their surprise, one of the Mirages they fight speaks to them and introduces himself as Vivi.[~][~]It turns out Vivi is quite the friendly sort, and he convinces the other Mirages to stop fighting and start fixing. With their help, Mako Reactor 0 is back up and running in no time.[~][~]As the mako energies begin to stir beneath the sands, Edgar stands ready. He gives the order, and his desert fortress charges forward. It strains, it shudders, it pulls against the chain. It trembles, it creaks, and then with a deafening crack, it snaps![~][~]With Figaro free at last, Reynn and Lann are ready to move on. As a surprise bonus, Vivi produces the Key of Earth from beneath his robes. Better yet, Edgar tells the twins where to look for the next key. On the other side of Big Bridge is a continent perpetually covered in darkness. Could this be the “land of naught but night” where the Key of Shadows lies?[~][~]Reynn and Lann bid the desert adieu, and journey west toward Big Bridge.

In the end, they have no idea who he was or what he wanted, but there’s not much else to do but shrug and move on.[~][~]Reynn and Lann part ways with Bartz at the end of Big Bridge, and head off into the land of naught but night in search of a town.

EV17_DETAILED_TEXT_07;[~]Cid tells the duo that the final key is likely on Besaid, the continent directly above them. Reynn and Lann head out, bidding their Tometown friends good-bye.

EV18_DETAILED_TEXT_01_00;"[~]Reynn and Lann discover a moonlit train station, but the tracks are cut, leading nowhere. The Cactuar Conductor pops out, and tells the twins that this train does indeed go to the continent above them. Confused as to how a trackless train goes anywhere, they nevertheless hop on board.[~][~]The train is cleared for liftoff, and lift off it does
EV18_DETAILED_TEXT_01_01;Reynn and Lann splash out of the warm coastal waters of Besaid. Spotting a town nearby, they head on in to see what information they can gather about this underwater temple they’re looking for.
EV18_DETAILED_TEXT_02_00;[~]Sadly, no one seems to know how to get to the temple in the deep. Reynn and Lann are just about ready to throw in the beach towel when they notice an odd little sign. “Pantologist Always Here to Assist,” it reads. Well, it’s a long shot, but they might as well check it out.[~][~]Stepping into this pantologist’s shop, they are confronted with a rather unique sort of individual: the dazzling master of magic, Shantotto!

They’re now able to breathe underwater, but the catch is that they can no longer breathe out of it![~][~]Shantotto unceremoniously stuffs the gasping twins into barrels of water before handing them off to Tidus, with instructions to take them to the Sunken Temple.

EV18_DETAILED_TEXT_04;"[~]Reynn and Lann track down the Quacho Queen inside the temple. She seems friendly enough at first, but the second she catches sight of Lann she goes into a tizzy and attacks. The twins manage to deliver a suitable trouncing, and she flees, sobbing.[~][~]In her wake, she leaves a shining red jewel
EV18_DETAILED_TEXT_05;[~]Further into the Sunken Temple the twins go, and they are treated to the sight of all-out quacho warfare. The quachos’ opponent, a massive tonberry, sends the Quacho Queen flying before turning its deadly sights on Reynn and Lann.
EV18_DETAILED_TEXT_06;"[~]The tonberry falls at last, and the twins get their hands on the final key. Trading the quacho ruby for the antidote, Reynn and Lann can finally breathe on land again. But as they walk out of the surf and onto the turf, they find a huffing and puffing Yuna.[~][~]Yuna’s been looking for them. According to her, both Rydia and Eiko disappeared shortly after meeting Reynn and Lann. She fears that someone is after the summoners...[~][~]And speak of the plumed devil, the Plumed Knight appears in a flurry of feathers and carries Yuna away! Tidus jets after her, as do the twins
EV19_DETAILED_TEXT_00;Reynn and Lann stare in wonder at the shining stairs, when a hooded woman appears from out of nowhere. The woman tells them that if they climb these stairs, they will find the Crystal Tower...and their mother, Lusse Farna. Then, without another word, she disappears.[~][~]Lann is gung ho and ready to get climbing, but Reynn is worried about this strange woman’s motives. Still, they don’t really have any better options, so it’s up they go.
EV19_DETAILED_TEXT_01;[~]At the top of the stairs, Reynn and Lann find a town that looks almost exactly like Nine Wood Hills...

EV19_DETAILED_TEXT_02_01;Something seems wrong with Terra, but the twins don’t have time to puzzle it out, for she attacks! They manage to knock the wild-eyed Terra out, and Reynn wonders who she is and why she attacked them. Chances are if she wakes up, she’ll just attack them again, so the twins leave her and enter the tower.[~][~]After Reynn and Lann have left, the Knight in the Golden Mask appears out of thin air. He stares in the direction the twins vanished, a slow smirk spreading across his face...[~][~]The stairs inside the Crystal Tower seem to go on forever. Reynn and Lann look up, sigh, and start trudging their way upward.

EV20_DETAILED_TEXT_00_00;At the top of the Crystal Tower sits a man on a throne. Next to him lies a cage, a woman trapped inside. Reynn and Lann move to save her, but the man on the throne, Brandelis, will not let them have her without a fight.[~][~]As they triumph in their victory over Brandelis, the hooded woman once again appears before them. If they activate the Ultima Gate, she says, they should be able to destroy the cage.[~][~]Reynn remembers that the hooded woman is Hauyn, whom they once knew and thought of almost as kin.

But how can there be two of them? Wheeling around, the twins see the hooded woman—the woman they thought was Hauyn—collapse into an empty heap of clothing. The beautiful room melts away, shifting to reveal an ugly, dirty place. The missing summoners, along with Terra, are bound around a warped hole carved out of the very stuff of reality. The Knight in the Golden Mask and the Plumed Knight are there as well, looking pleased.[~][~]From within the darkness of that angry hole an evil-looking gate appears. Out of this gate pours Mirage after monstrous Mirage. They smash a hole in the tower, and fly out into Grymoire beyond.

They have but one purpose: to destroy not just Grymoire, but every world there is.[~][~]If this news wasn’t bad enough, all of this is, in a way, all their fault.
