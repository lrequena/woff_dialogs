sub25_060_0000;This is the place where...he lost her...
sub25_060_0001;Rrraaah!
sub25_060_0002;Kyaaaaaa!
sub25_060_0003;Huh?!
sub25_060_0004;What the...
sub25_060_0005;It’s coming from over there. Hurry!
sub25_060_0006;(SENT FLYING by the black fox)
sub25_060_0007;Why? That Mirage—why do I loathe it with every fiber of my being?!
sub25_060_0008;If you’re my Uncle Takka,[~]then of course you would despise that Mirage.
sub25_060_0009;Hm? Is that Refia? And you...
sub25_060_0010;Uh, hiya.
sub25_060_0011;Ha ha ha ha![~]Once again, I feel the pull of destiny!
sub25_060_0012;Boy, am I really [f2]not[/f] glad to see you.
sub25_060_0013;Tell me, Refia.[~]Why is it natural I would hate that thing?
sub25_060_0014;You can tell me first:[~]who am I really talking to?
sub25_060_0015;Me? A knight of the Bahamutian Army.[~]But this flesh I inhabit belonged to the human you so lovingly called Takka.
sub25_060_0016;His body?[~]Then you’ve...possessed him?
sub25_060_0017;So, then...where [f2]is[/f] he?
sub25_060_0018;Dead, for quite some time now.
sub25_060_0019;......!
sub25_060_0020;Monster. Is that what you consider honor?!
sub25_060_0021;Oh no. Those are the rules of this world.[~]The human body is a weakness—the door most easily breached.
sub25_060_0022;......
sub25_060_0023;Enough of this. You will answer my question.[~]Why do I bear such incredible enmity for that Mirage?
sub25_060_0024;That guy whose body you’re camping out in?[~]His wife was [f2]killed[/f] by that Mirage.
sub25_060_0025;If you look at that fox and feel hatred for it, it means his memory—[~]no, his soul still lives on inside of you.
sub25_060_0026;That’s absurd. No trace of him could remain.[~]And yet, the hatred inside of me... It is unmistakable.
sub25_060_0027;Heh. Heh heh heh.[~]Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!
sub25_060_0028;Oh, I see! Another twist of fate, yes! Of course.[~]And your arrival is one of the resulting kinks. I see it!
sub25_060_0029;Fascinating! Let us test this portentous bond,[~]and see just how fast it holds!
sub25_060_0030;Wuh-oh. If we let that karmic kook find the black fox and kill it,[~]won’t that ruin all of our chances?
sub25_060_0031;D’agh! Let’s go after him, Reynn!
sub25_060_0032;Right!
