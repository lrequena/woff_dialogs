npc_tina_0000_0000;Is something wrong?
npc_tina_0000_0001;There are things I must do. I’m the only one who can!
npc_tina_0000_0002;Now that the world is in such danger...
npc_tina_0001_0000;Don’t worry about me. I can always turn to Yuna, Rydia, and Eiko.
npc_tina_0001_0001;Be careful, both of you. You need to control your powers. Never let them run wild.
npc_tina_0001_0002;(DO NOT RECORD)
npc_tina_0002_0000;Back when he still had power over me, Segwarides forced me to control all sorts of different Magitek machines.
npc_tina_0002_0001;And now, for all I know, my actions are directly related to the machines that have started attacking people.
npc_tina_0002_0002;I’m not foolish enough to believe that I can make up for what I’ve done. But all the same, I know that I have to try. I will fight the Cogna and any Mirages that threaten our world.
