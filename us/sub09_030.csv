sub09_030_0003;Our Mirage opponents have been getting steadily stronger.
sub09_030_0004;Heh, hoo, hah... I know I’m tough,[~]but even [f2]I’m[/f] starting to feel the burn here. Hot dang!
sub09_030_0005;Oh! Let’s stack, kupo!
sub09_030_0006;Stack what?
sub09_030_0007;Us, kupo![~]I mean if those twin goobers can do it, we can too, kupo!
sub09_030_0008;You’re right.[~]They [f2]do[/f] get a lot stronger when they stack, now don’t they?
sub09_030_0009;Hmm... So how do we decide the order?
sub09_030_0010;First, we have to pick a leader, kupo.[~]How 'bout...we do rock-paper-scissors for it, kupo?
sub09_030_0011;Me and the cap’n do it all the time, kupo!
sub09_030_0012;Are you sure?
sub09_030_0013;Rooock... Paperrr... KUPO!
sub09_030_0014;Guys? How are we supposed to figure out who won?
sub09_030_0015;Good point. Our hands aren’t made for this...
sub09_030_0016;Yippee, kupo! Mog takes the prize, kupo!
sub09_030_0017;Huh?
sub09_030_0018;Heh?
sub09_030_0019;So with that settled,[~]your new leader will assign the positions, kupo.
sub09_030_0020;......
sub09_030_0021;Ohhh... All right.
sub09_030_0022;’Kay, here we kupo!
sub09_030_0023;I must say, my head’s getting kind of itchy...
sub09_030_0024;I can’t move.
sub09_030_0025;Why you...
sub09_030_0026;Kupoooooo!
sub09_030_0027;Cactwaaaaaa!
sub09_030_0028;Yaaaaaah.
sub09_030_0029;Ugh! How does master expect this to help me train?!
sub09_030_0030;Wait, is that a human?
sub09_030_0031;Somer...[f2]sault![/f]
sub09_030_0032;Hmm... Now we know what got into the Mirages.[~]The young lady is a bona fide public menace!
sub09_030_0033;Yes, I would agree.
sub09_030_0034;Okay, then we have to stop her, kupo!
sub09_030_0035;I’ll take you all on! Let’s do this!
sub09_030_0036;Meteor Strike!
sub09_030_0037;Oof. She’s too...powerful...
sub09_030_0038;Oh! Hey, I have an idea, kupo!
sub09_030_0039;Whisper whisper, whisper whisper...
sub09_030_0040;Right then! Let’s go ahead and give it a shot!
sub09_030_0041;Oh, it’s on.
sub09_030_0042;Come on, try and get me![~]I’m talkin’ to [f2]you[/f], fighter girl!
sub09_030_0043;Huh? Not you again! Beat it, cactuar!
sub09_030_0044;Zip!
sub09_030_0045;Huh? I missed?
sub09_030_0046;Haaa ha ha ha! You think you know how to train? I AM A TRAIN![~]...I mean, I run one. Let’s go! Neener neener neener, I’m right hee-ere... Ha!
sub09_030_0047;Guess who? Tonberry in the house.
sub09_030_0048;Poke.
sub09_030_0049;————!!!
sub09_030_0050;Hey! That didn’t feel good!

sub09_030_0055;We did it! KO!
sub09_030_0056;Whew... I think we had better send this young lady back to Grymoire.
sub09_030_0057;Seems to me...that the three of us make one dashing duo, kupo!
sub09_030_0058;Indeed!
sub09_030_0059;Heh?
