PortTown_npc_02_A;Is it true that there’s a big house at the bottom of the ocean?
PortTown_npc_02_B_01;Know what they call the house below the ocean? The Sunken Temple!
PortTown_npc_02_B_02;I wish I could breathe underwater. Then I’d go and visit it myself.
PortTown_npc_02_C;Aaah! Why’re all these weird machines attacking us? If only I could breathe underwater, I could hide from them in the ocean!
PortTown_npc_02_D_01;Hey, you wouldn’t happen to know how I can learn to breathe underwater, would you? I wanna go and search for the Sunken Temple more than anything!
PortTown_npc_02_D_02;Huh? You think that’s a really bad idea? Why’s that? Come on, tell me!
