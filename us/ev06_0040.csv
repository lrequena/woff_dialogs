ev06_0040_0000_0;Oooh! Is this for warming up?
ev06_0040_0000_1;Oh, this looks nice and toasty.
ev06_0040_0000;Excuse me. How much do you want for this?
ev06_0040_0001;Hmm? Wait a sec.[~]Tell me you’re not planning to cross the ice fields.
ev06_0040_0002;We kind of have to get to Saronia.
ev06_0040_0003;Ugh... Forget it, don’t even bother.
ev06_0040_0004;Making the trip at this time of year[~]would be difficult enough on its own.
ev06_0040_0005;But for a while now, the ridge has been overrun[~]by nasty Mirages. No traveler is safe.
ev06_0040_0006;Jiant or Lilikin, you would be torn right to pieces.
ev06_0040_0007;Oh yeah? We can handle some Mirages.[~]You can just point us right at those suckas. Ha ha ha ha!
ev06_0040_0008;Huh?
ev06_0040_0009;Oh, you see, we’re Mirage Keepers.
ev06_0040_0010;And we’re actually on a journey right now[~]to gather as many of them as we can.
ev06_0040_0011;Right?
ev06_0040_0012;Yes the-sirree!
ev06_0040_0013;Oh wow! We have had a lot of guests over the years,[~]but you two are definitely my first ever Mirage Keepers!
ev06_0040_0014;Uh, excuse me?
ev06_0040_0015;Hm?
ev06_0040_0016;Um... Sorry to intrude.[~]My name is Refia.
ev06_0040_0017;You see, I’ve been stuck here in the inn for a while now[~]because of all the Mirages in Icicle Ridge.
ev06_0040_0018;Refia.
ev06_0040_0019;Are you certain about this?
ev06_0040_0020;Yes. I’ve made up my mind.
ev06_0040_0021;Hmm...
ev06_0040_0022;Don’t give me that look.[~]I won’t stop you. Honestly...
ev06_0040_0023;Ugh... Hey, Mirage Keepers.
ev06_0040_0024;Huh?
ev06_0040_0025;Yes?
ev06_0040_0026;You did say you’re on your way to Saronia, right?
ev06_0040_0027;That’s right.
ev06_0040_0028;In fact, you might say that we’re[~]on a mission of sorts for Cornelia,
ev06_0040_0029;so we can’t stay here long.
ev06_0040_0030;Good grief.[~]I must be the only one around here with a lick of sense.
ev06_0040_0031;Okay, fine, you win.[~]But at least take along the warlock’s warmer.
ev06_0040_0032;In exchange, I want you to let Refia here[~]go along on the trip with you.
ev06_0040_0033;She knows a bit of white magic.[~]You can’t say no to that.
ev06_0040_0034;Sherlotta!
ev06_0040_0035;Hey, no skin off my nose.
ev06_0040_0036;Or mine. Besides, if she can use white magic,[~]she’d really be doing [f2]us[/f] a favor.
ev06_0040_0037;Great! Everybody wins.
ev06_0040_0038;So! If that’s settled,[~]why not rest up before you go?
ev06_0040_0039;NOT USED
