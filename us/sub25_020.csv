sub25_020_0000;Wooow.[~]So [f2]this[/f] is what the inside of this place actually looks like.
sub25_020_0001;Wait! The Guardians are real?![~]Does this mean that faeries who steal your teeth are too?!
sub25_020_0002;Hm? Are you here for tea?[~]I don’t think I was expecting guests.
sub25_020_0003;Oh yes. I may very well have collected her lives.[~]But, whatever’s done is done.
sub25_020_0004;Huh?
sub25_020_0005;I cannot return any lives that were spent to traverse time. Sorry.
sub25_020_0006;But...but there’s gotta be...
sub25_020_0007;There must be [f2]some[/f] secret trick.
sub25_020_0008;A secret trick?
sub25_020_0009;[f2]Hey, I have an idea! Why don’t we track down a kyubi?[~]Aren’t they part of the same tribe of Mirages that Tama is?[/f]
sub25_020_0010;Huh?
sub25_020_0011;[f2]To manipulate time, Tama used more than one of her lives, right?[~]If I’m not mistaken, she had what—about nine lives in total?[/f]
sub25_020_0012;[f2]What if we swapped some of her lives out?[~]Then we could go back before she made her sacrifice[~]and replace some of her lives with the lives of a kyubi instead![/f]
sub25_020_0013;She turned time back so far she needed to use nine lives?
sub25_020_0014;Hmm... But you may be on to something.[~]A Mirage from the same tribe with the same kind of soul[~]could offer some souls in Tama’s place.
sub25_020_0015;You mean it?!
sub25_020_0016;Serafie, dude! Now [f2]that’s[/f] a secret trick!
sub25_020_0017;Hmm? Oh! Wh-what did you say again?
sub25_020_0018;Okay. If you can bring me a kyubi, I’ll help you out.
sub25_020_0019;So like, the kyubi is a Mirage? ’Cause I haven’t seen one.[~]Where do we find it?
sub25_020_0020;I’ll try the Rumor Radar.[~]I’ll limit the search to yurugus and other fox-like Mirages like Tama.
sub25_020_0021;Ohhh! Look out kids, I think we have a winner!
sub25_020_0022;What do you mean, “winner”?
sub25_020_0023;It seems that some lady was killed[~]in the Saronian ice fields by a giant black fox. Or so I heard.
sub25_020_0024;In that case, Sherlotta might know more about it.[~]Let’s go!
