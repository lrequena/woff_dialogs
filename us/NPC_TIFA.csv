npc_tifa_0000_0000;This way.
npc_tifa_0001_0000;A while back, there used to be a town called Mist here. But then a big disaster left the town in ruin.
npc_tifa_0001_0001;Afterward, a company called Shinra came along and offered to help rebuild.
npc_tifa_0001_0002;A lot can change in a decade, you know. When you look around, it’s hard to find so much as a trace of Mist anymore...
npc_tifa_0002_0000;Be careful.
npc_tifa_0002_0001;How’re you doing?
npc_tifa_0002_0002;What a relief to hear that Rydia’s okay. Thank goodness.
npc_tifa_0003_0000;Did you know that Cloud and I grew up together?
npc_tifa_0003_0001;I wasn’t sure it was him at first, but the chocobo haircut definitely had me wondering.
npc_tifa_0003_0002;It’s just that he’s changed a lot from how I remember him. And when I say a lot, I mean a [f2]lot[/f].
npc_tifa_0003_0003;Still, I finally worked up my nerve and spoke to him. And sure enough, it was the same boy I knew.
npc_tifa_0003_0004;It sounds like he’s been through some bad times, though. Just some really sad stuff, you know?
npc_tifa_0003_0005;I wish I could be a bigger part of his life and help him get through it all.
npc_tifa_0003_0006;Uhh...as a friend, I mean. You know, it’s not like I— Right, anyway!
