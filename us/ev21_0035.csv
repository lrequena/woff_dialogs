ev21_0035_0000;Gates are nice, but there’s nothing like taking to the skies and the-watching the world rush by.
ev21_0035_0001;Yeah! It’s like the start of a new adventure!
ev21_0035_0002;I know, it’s exciting. But don’t forget that if we want to help everyone, we have to use that door in Nine Wood Hills.
ev21_0035_0003;Don’t worry about it, Sis. We know the clock’s ticking.
ev21_0035_0004;Still, we might be better off using the airship when we’re the-trying to hunt down Mirages.
ev21_0035_0005;Why’s that?
ev21_0035_0006;I’m the-glad you asked!
ev21_0035_0007;Holy mom bomb!
ev21_0035_0008;Oh wow! We can use this to find the Mirages we’ve missed?
ev21_0035_0009;It’s all spelled the-out in the manual over there!
