ev04_0010_0000_3;[s40]A Legendary Warrior[/s]
ev04_0010_0001;Okay then. Let’s check in with Princess Sarah.
ev04_0010_0002;It’s the Bahamutian Army!
ev04_0010_0003;What? They’re here already?
ev04_0010_0004;They’re setting up camp, right outside of town!
ev04_0010_0005;Reynn! Lann!
ev04_0010_0006;Oh, perfect timing.[~]We were actually just on our way to see you.
ev04_0010_0007;If they’ve established a camp near our gates,[~]then clearly they must intend to finish us once and for all.
ev04_0010_0008;So what now?
ev04_0010_0009;Seems to me...we’re going to have to nip[~]this little problem in the butt.
ev04_0010_0010;Hm? What do you propose we do?
ev04_0010_0011;[f2]We[/f] should take the fight to [f2]them[/f].
ev04_0010_0012;Uh, well said, but as things stand,[~]Cornelia simply does not have the manpower.
ev04_0010_0013;If you can just buy us some time, we’ll do the rest.
ev04_0010_0014;Huh?
ev04_0010_0015;Me and Reynn’ll sneak up on their boss and take him out!
ev04_0010_0016;What?!
ev04_0010_0017;Hmm...
ev04_0010_0018;I-is it really that simple?
ev04_0010_0019;Well, he may not exactly look it,[~]but Lann’s pretty good in a fight.
ev04_0010_0020;Thing is, he used to get picked on[~]for being such a pip-squeak.
ev04_0010_0021;Please! As if you were ever any taller than me.
ev04_0010_0022;Well, I might have made up the “pip-squeak” part,[~]but, he definitely did get picked on.
ev04_0010_0023;I think that maybe the other kids[~]were a little creeped out by our arms.
ev04_0010_0024;......
ev04_0010_0025;......
ev04_0010_0026;Still, we were always kind of proud that we looked like this.[~]Because it meant we were just like our mom, right?
ev04_0010_0027;...I guess.
ev04_0010_0028;So! Let’s talk more about Lann getting picked on![~]Boy, did they make him cry.
ev04_0010_0029;But, after I whipped him into shape,[~]he never lost a fight again.
ev04_0010_0030;H-how wonderful!
ev04_0010_0031;But that’s not ’cause he turned into[~]some kind of bully-destroying machine.
ev04_0010_0032;He just literally never picked a fight he couldn’t win.
ev04_0010_0033;Really, his threat assessment skills were uncanny.[~]He always knew the odds.
ev04_0010_0034;Heh. Call it natural cowardice.
ev04_0010_0035;Hey! Watch it.
ev04_0010_0036;So Lann... How ’bout it?[~]Do you think we can beat those guys?
ev04_0010_0037;Piece of cake! Well, not a [f2]piece[/f] of cake.[~]More like...a very large sliver of cake.
ev04_0010_0038;Well, there you have it. So, are you willing to trust us?
ev04_0010_0039;Very well then.
ev04_0010_0040;We must act. It is only a matter of time[~]before the Federation completely overruns Cornelia.
ev04_0010_0041;We will fight...and place our faith in the Mirage Keepers.
ev04_0010_0042;[f2]Huh... What a weird thing to remember.[~]I know someone bullied Lann.[~]But why can’t I remember who?[/f]
