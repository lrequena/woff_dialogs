ev03_0027_0000;Hey Tama, weird question: um, how come all this really useful, well-presented information keeps popping into our heads?
ev03_0027_0001;Oh, that? I guess Enna Kros’s the-trying to give you some tips!
ev03_0027_0002;Dude, really? And here I thought I was some kind of super genius coming up with all the answers on my own.
ev03_0027_0003;I hate to the-break it to you, but you will never the-be that person.
ev03_0027_0004;I know... It’s so sad.
ev03_0027_0005;Whoa! Hey now, c’mon. You don’t have to look [f2]that[/f] brokenhearted when you say it...
