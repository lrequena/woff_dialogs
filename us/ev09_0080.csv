ev09_0080_0000;Hwuh?
ev09_0080_0001;Aaah!
ev09_0080_0002;Whoa! What was that?
ev09_0080_0003;Oooh! Real actual people![~]I thought I might’ve been seeing things.
ev09_0080_0004;Uh, who are you?
ev09_0080_0005;Oh! My bad. My name’s Rikku!
ev09_0080_0006;Man, I wish that Mirage hadn’t come along[~]and trashed my boat, ’cause I was having[~]a [f2]great[/f] day of treasure hunting.
ev09_0080_0007;I’m a good swimmer so it’s no biggie,[~]but I was really starting to get pooped.
ev09_0080_0008;Then I spotted you guys sailing along[~]on top of old Adamantoise here.
ev09_0080_0009;So, is there some story behind all this?
ev09_0080_0010;The more the merrier. Enjoy the cruise.
ev09_0080_0011;Thank you!
ev09_0080_0012;Man, how totally awesome are you Mirage Keepers![~]It can’t be easy befriending an adamantoise!
ev09_0080_0013;Honestly, I think we just happened[~]to bump into a really nice one.
ev09_0080_0014;Hmm. Oh! So you’re trying to get to the Babil region, right?[~]You need to set a course thataway!
