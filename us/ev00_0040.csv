ev00_0040_0000;Hey, I’m here!
ev00_0040_0001;Huh? How’d she get in if no one’s here yet?
ev00_0040_0002;Good morning! I’m real sorry.[~]I hope you haven’t been waiting long.
ev00_0040_0003;Oh, right! She needs some water.
ev00_0040_0004;Oh, no thanks. A pint—[~]I mean, a cup of coffee, please.
ev00_0040_0005;Oh, and bring the whole jar of sugar.[~]I’m gonna need it.
ev00_0040_0006;Right, that’s one cuppa joe.[~]And I’ll get you one of the big jars.
ev00_0040_0007;Ugh. Has nobody made the coffee yet?[~]Come on, get it together, guys.
ev00_0040_0008;I’m sorry, miss. This might take a while.
ev00_0040_0009;Hey, no hurry! Time’s not an issue.
ev00_0040_0010;Here you go.

ev00_0040_0014;Hey, don’t talk down to me.[~]Listen, last time I checked, little bro,[~]I’ve been around a few minutes longer than you.
ev00_0040_0015;Okay, okay! I get it already! Very sorry!

ev00_0040_0016;So, what’s up? I’m [f2]all[/f] ears.
ev00_0040_0017;Well you don’t have to get all sarcas— Uh...
ev00_0040_0018;You really [f2]are[/f] all ears.
ev00_0040_0019;Uh, what?
ev00_0040_0020;Forget it.[~]So Lann, have you seen anybody this morning?
ev00_0040_0021;Well, yeah. I mean, I’m looking right at you, aren’t I?[~]And there’s that customer.
ev00_0040_0022;What?
ev00_0040_0023;Aaah! H-hello.
ev00_0040_0024;You didn’t even see her? Dude.
