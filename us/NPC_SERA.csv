npc_sera_0000_0000;I am certain that you will come through for us.
npc_sera_0000_0001;Is something the matter?
npc_sera_0000_0002;Please make yourself right at home.
npc_sera_0000_0003;I believe...that the light of hope always vanquishes the darkness of despair.
npc_sera_0000_0004;Greetings, friends.
npc_sera_0000_0005;Before reaching Saronia, you will need to pass through the northern forest, and from there traverse a vast and icy expanse.
npc_sera_0000_0006;But I must warn you: both places are swarming with Mirages. Promise me that you will all be careful.
