PortTown_npc_06_A;GILBRYK! BLRGYLARGLBLK!
PortTown_npc_06_B_01;Oh, thank goodness! Let me tell you, it is such a relief to be able to speak normally again! I fell victim to one of Doctor Shantotto’s curses. A word of advice: be REAL careful what you ask of her.
PortTown_npc_06_B_02;I mean, I’d heard that she was kind of eccentric, but...I never thought she’d make it so I could only say things like HNGJBAPYRTL!
PortTown_npc_06_C_01;I can’t believe everything that’s KNGDRPOODLK— Oh!
PortTown_npc_06_C_02;Ugh, I thought that Doctor Shantotto’s curse was supposed to have worn off by this point! But every now and then, it still comes back to bite me in the tongue...
PortTown_npc_06_D_01;Anyway, I’m glad that things are back to IDPABLWAAH!
PortTown_npc_06_D_02;As for me, I’ve come to terms with my...condition. It’ll be a great way to stand out from the HJIFFABW!
