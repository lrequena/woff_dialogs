ev10_add_02_0000;Man, I wish I was as strong as a dragon. I’d be all like “mrrrooow!”
ev10_add_02_0001;Which would make you one [f2]strange[/f] dragon, but I agree. The Mirages we’re facing have been getting tougher and tougher.
ev10_add_02_0002;You the-need to learn to exploit your Mirages’ elemental resistances.
ev10_add_02_0003;You want us to blow them up?
ev10_add_02_0004;Um, that’s “explode,” and while I’d love to give you credit for the first four letters, you clearly weren’t listening.
ev10_add_02_0005;I was listening! They’re mental resistors.
ev10_add_02_0006;Ugh! That’s clearly what [f2]you’ve[/f] got.
