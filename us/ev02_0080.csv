ev02_0080_0000;Thank you for coming.[~]Welcome to the kingdom of Cornelia.[~]I am Princess Sarah.
ev02_0080_0001;Wait, you’re like, a princess?
ev02_0080_0002;We had no idea!
ev02_0080_0003;Oh my gosh.[~]I am so sorry Lann acted[~]like such a royal idiot.
ev02_0080_0004;I’m not royal!
ev02_0080_0005;Oh, and I’m his older sister, Reynn.[~]It’s an honor.
ev02_0080_0006;Please forgive the ruse. At first, I suspected[~]that you might be agents sent here by Bahamut.
ev02_0080_0007;I was wrong. You stood up bravely against their Mirages,[~]and kept our town safe. All of Cornelia thanks you.
ev02_0080_0008;Oh, I wouldn’t say we were [f2]that[/f] brave. Really.
ev02_0080_0009;Stop, you’re so modest.
ev02_0080_0010;Still, the fact of the matter is,[~]we didn’t do anything all that outstanding.
ev02_0080_0011;Yeah, we’re more the “instanding” types.
ev02_0080_0012;Hwah? I’m pretty the-sure that “instanding”[~]isn’t an actual the-word.
ev02_0080_0013;Tee hee... Ha ha ha!
ev02_0080_0014;Oh! Forgive me. It’s just so hard to believe[~]that you two are the stuff of prophecies.
ev02_0080_0015;Prophecies? Oh, that’s right...[~]I think I heard the townsfolk going on[~]about some kind of prophecy too.
ev02_0080_0016;Oh, I am sorry. If you will permit me,[~]I will explain it from the beginning.
ev02_0080_0017;You see, Cornelia is an unfederated state midway up Grymoire.
ev02_0080_0018;Unfederated?
ev02_0080_0019;Yes. Let me explain that as well. The majority of Grymoire's countries[~]and municipalities have annexed themselves to the Bahamutian[~]Federation, under the rule of Brandelis, the Herald King.
ev02_0080_0020;NOT USED
ev02_0080_0021;Cornelia, however, has continued to maintain its sovereignty.
ev02_0080_0022;The Federation has made attempts[~]to erode this stance countless times.
ev02_0080_0023;But we have held our ground,[~]and now Bahamut has taken to armed provocation.
ev02_0080_0024;You mean like, that Mirage attack before?
ev02_0080_0025;Yes.
ev02_0080_0026;So where does this “prophecy” factor in?
ev02_0080_0027;The Azure Prophecy speaks of a divergence.
ev02_0080_0028;When time begins its march anew, they shall return as visitors:[~]Jiants from the Hills of a world not our own.
ev02_0080_0029;"Upon Grymoire, they will wreak two divergent futures:[~]one that brings salvation
ev02_0080_0030;an enigma to confound even the highest mind.
ev02_0080_0031;The Jiants may...wreak two futures?
ev02_0080_0032;“Reek,” huh?
ev02_0080_0033;*Sniff, sniff* Oh man![~]Tama, this prophecy’s about you!
ev02_0080_0034;Wh-wh-what are you the-talking about?[~]There’s nothing the-wrong with the way I smell![~]You big the-[f2]dummy![/f]
ev02_0080_0035;NOT USED
ev02_0080_0036;Well, at least I’m dumber than [f2]you![/f]
ev02_0080_0036_1;Grrrrrr!
ev02_0080_0036_2;GRRRRRR!
ev02_0080_0037;I’m sorry, Your Highness.[~]I’m afraid there’s just no hope for them.
ev02_0080_0038;Oh. Uhh...
ev02_0080_0039;[f2]So, “the Jiants from the Hills”...[~]As in Nine Wood Hills?[/f]
ev02_0080_0040;[f2]I guess it’s one of those “believe-what-you-want-to” things,[~]but yeah, so far, it does seem to match up.[/f]
ev02_0080_0041;Um, do you mind if I ask you a slightly awkward question?
ev02_0080_0042;If this federation is really so terrible,[~]why have so many countries agreed to become members?
ev02_0080_0043;Most of the Mirages in Grymoire—[~]not all, but certainly most of them—[~]are now firmly under the Federation’s control.
ev02_0080_0044;With such a powerful army behind them,[~]citizens can go about their lives[~]without fearing the Mirages that still roam free.
ev02_0080_0045;Dude, they control [f2]that[/f] many Mirages?[~]Seriously?!
ev02_0080_0046;Y-yes! Uh, “dude.”
ev02_0080_0046_1;Whoaaa.
ev02_0080_0047;King Brandelis’s Herald lieutenants,[~]known as Segwarides and Pellinore,
ev02_0080_0048;command all of Grymoire’s Mirages with the same authority[~]as the famous Queen of the Keepers of ages past.
ev02_0080_0049;So there was a Queen of the Keepers?[~]Sounds like she was pretty powerful.
ev02_0080_0050;Yes, but that was more than a century ago.
ev02_0080_0051;So...sorry for the string of dumb questions, but,
ev02_0080_0052;if the Federation can guarantee that kind of absolute protection,[~]wouldn’t it be worthwhile to take them up on their offer?
ev02_0080_0053;It may [f2]seem[/f] wise...[~]But you see, membership in the Federation involves[~]following their laws, and adoption...of a heinous creed.
ev02_0080_0054;It chills me, right to the marrow of my bones.
ev02_0080_0055;That bad?
ev02_0080_0056;Yes. I beg you, see for yourselves.[~]Once you have done so, well...you will understand.
ev02_0080_0057;All right, then.
ev02_0080_0058;Now then. May I ask what the two of you intend to do next?
ev02_0080_0059;Well, whatever’s going on out there,[~]the only thing we can do right now[~]is just keep rounding up more Mirages, am I right?
ev02_0080_0060;Oh?
ev02_0080_0061;Apparently, at one time we commanded a whole legion of them.[~]But somehow, we lost them, along with our memories.
ev02_0080_0062;So, we’re hoping by getting the Mirages back,[~]we might stumble on some clues about our past.
ev02_0080_0063;That’s right. So if Mirages like those goblins[~]are bugging you, we can lay down the smack.
ev02_0080_0064;Lay down...the what?
ev02_0080_0065;Uh, I think what he’s trying to say is we’ll help you out.[~]Or at least, in the best way we know how.
ev02_0080_0066;Oh, wonderful![~]You have my thanks.[~]Mine and all Cornelia’s.
ev02_0080_0067;Still, if we’re going to be any help,[~]don’t you think we need to beef up our arsenal first?
ev02_0080_0068;’Cause we can’t put up much of a fight[~]without some strong Mirages.
ev02_0080_0069;Good point. Princess, do you know of any nearby places[~]where strong Mirages live?
ev02_0080_0070;Certainly. If you travel to the northeast of Cornelia,[~]you will find the Nether Nebula,
ev02_0080_0071;a network of caverns inhabited by many wild Mirages.
ev02_0080_0072;Ooh! Nice.
ev02_0080_0073;Not at all. Savage Mirages have been sighted in the Nebula.[~]You may well end up dead.
ev02_0080_0074;NOT USED
ev02_0080_0075;Th-that’s cool.
ev02_0080_0076;If you insist upon going,[~]then please take the utmost caution.
ev02_0080_0077;He will, Your Highness.[~]Otherwise he’s gonna be [f2]extremely[/f] sorry.
ev02_0080_0078;Wait a minute. Why just me? What’d I do?!
ev02_0080_0078_1;Princess Sarah
ev02_0080_0079;Wassup, guys! Nice armor.
ev02_0080_0080;Leave them alone, please.
