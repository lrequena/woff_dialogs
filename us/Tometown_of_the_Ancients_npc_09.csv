Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_09_A_01;I was attacked by this Mirage and [f2]apparently[/f] turned into a vampire.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_09_A_02;Of course, I can’t remember any of it.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_09_A_03;But it is [f2]really[/f] scary to think I might’ve stayed that way forever.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_09_B_01;What [f2]are[/f] those mechanical monstrosities?
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_09_B_02;I’m starting to wish I was a vampire again just so I don’t have to think about it.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_09_C_01;First, I got turned into a vampire... Then, I thought I was going to get turned into a machine.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_09_C_02;It sure is nice to not have to worry about that stuff anymore.
