npc_quistis_0000_0000;Good luck.
npc_quistis_0000_0001;The manual will tell you how to operate the airship.
npc_quistis_0000_0002;Sorry, I’m a little preoccupied right now.
npc_quistis_0000_0003;All right, what’s next on the list...
npc_quistis_0000_0004;So, how’s it going?
npc_quistis_0000_0005;We need to ensure the safety of our world.
npc_quistis_0001_0000;Sorry, you two. There have been some...developments that make it even harder for me to give you full run of the place.
npc_quistis_0002_0000;Could it be possible that every technologically advanced facility in the world is in reality some kind of ancient Mirage?
npc_quistis_0003_0000;The machines you encountered in Midgar, under Figaro Castle? Those were originally discovered here in Balamb Garden.
npc_quistis_0003_0001;We thought the machines might help Shinra deal with the Mirages while they investigated.
npc_quistis_0003_0002;Of course, we would never have lent them out knowing what we know now.
npc_quistis_0003_0003;But! What’s done is done. We can’t take it back. We can only try not to make the same mistakes again.
npc_quistis_0004_0000;You know, at one point I wanted to become an instructor.
npc_quistis_0004_0001;I never thought fate would lead me to this Garden, let alone that I’d be fighting with the League of S to save the world.
npc_quistis_0004_0002;Life is always full of surprises, am I right?
