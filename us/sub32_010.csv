sub32_010_0001;Traveler. Test your strength?
sub32_010_0002;So there you are. The butcher.[~]You’ve hurt a lot of people.
sub32_010_0003;They call me a butcher? Rubbish.[~]I merely challenge fools who would be challenged, and they die.
sub32_010_0004;Then you’re not very sporting.[~]Every one of your victims was cut down without a fight.
sub32_010_0005;He who lives by the sword must be quick to draw it.[~]Truly, they met with no foul play.
sub32_010_0006;If they expired without a struggle,[~]that attests to their dearth of skill and not my lack of honor.
sub32_010_0007;Hmm... It is a troubling thought. To be gone less than a century,[~]and return to find swordsmanship so diminished. Troubling indeed...
sub32_010_0008;How poetic. If it’s a challenge you’re looking for,[~]why don’t you see how you and your principles fare against me!
sub32_010_0009;Ahh... Your spirit is impressive.[~]Let us begin!
