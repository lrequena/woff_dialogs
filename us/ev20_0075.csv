ev20_0080_0000;It’s good that we’re helping the League out, but remember, we need to round up more Mirages.
ev20_0080_0001;Tama, these “Cogna” things—can you tell us more about them? They look powerful.
ev20_0080_0002;Like Mirages, some the-Cogna are strong, and some not so the-much.
ev20_0080_0003;Then again, the tough ones are really, the-really the-tough.
ev20_0080_0004;In fact, some of the Cogna have such powerful defenses that regular attacks the-won’t even leave a scratch on them.
ev20_0080_0005;Dude, what?! How are we supposed to stop them then?
ev20_0080_0006;Remember, we’re not the only ones out there fighting. There’s Cloud, Squall, Lightning...
ev20_0080_0007;We’re all gonna have to learn to help each other out.
ev20_0080_0008;Right. Good point!
