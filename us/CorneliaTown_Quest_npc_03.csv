Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_A_01;Whatever am I going to do...?
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_A_02;My son insists upon seeing some Mirages up close, but I have no idea what he’s talking about.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_A_03;I say, do you think you might be able to find the one he’s talking about for him? I’ll make it well worth your while, of course.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_A_04;Well hello! Thank you [f2]so[/f] much for your help the other day. However, I’m afraid my son has yet another Mirage he wants to see.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_A_05;Would you mind humoring him again, please?
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_A_06;Of all the times for him to bring it up...
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_A_07;Oh, it’s you! Wonderful timing.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_A_08;Could I trouble you to look for another Mirage my son wishes to see?
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_01;There’s a Mirage I just [f2]have[/f] to see!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_02;I dunno its name, but it’s the one that kinda looks like this!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_03;Lemme know if you find it!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_04;Okay, so, it’s white, and fluffy, and it kinda looks like a tiny dog, but it isn’t really a dog.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_05;Okay, so, it’s water-colored, it hops around, and it goes “ribbit.” It’s slimy and gross and awesome!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_06;Okay, so, it’s a shiny gold box with lots of diamonds! I thought it was a treasure at first, but nope!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_07;Okay, so, it’s got a whole bunch of eyes, and a big mouth, and it stinks real bad.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_08;Okay, so, it’s like this huge robot you can ride around in!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_09;Okay, so, it’s a big, beautiful bird that’s got all the colors of the rainbow!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_10;Okay, so, it’s a pretty black cat with really big eyes. I guess the only bad part is that its face is kinda scary?
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_11;Okay, so, it’s a ghost with an orange mask and a really sharp choppy-thing!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_12;Okay, so, it’s like the king of the ocean! And it’s even got built-in camouflage!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_13;Okay, so, it’s an old man that shoots lightning and thunder, and he always spoils his granddaughter!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_14;Okay, so, it’s a pretty lady covered in ice! She’s even prettier than my mom!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_15;Okay, so, it’s a really tough-looking beast-man who’s always on fire! Oh, and the lightning-man’s always on his case, too.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_B_16;Okay, so, it’s a big, white, really beautiful fox who’s got lots of lives!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_C_01;I’m afraid I just don’t know which one he means. Can you figure it out and bring the Mirage he wants here?
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_C_02;My goodness, does a Mirage like that really exist? I don’t suppose you have any idea?
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_C_03;For the life of me, I don’t know where he gets it from. Why would anyone want to go out of their way to see a Mirage?
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_D;Do you think you could bring my son the Mirage he’s talking about?
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_E_01;Yes! That’s it! Woo! This is awesome! Thanks!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_E_02;Wow, it’s the real thing! I can’t believe I got to lay eyes on it!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_E_03;Whoa... This is amazing! It’s even bigger than I thought it’d be! Awesome!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_E_04;Is that...really it? Wow... So [f2]that’s[/f] what it looks like... Cooooool!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_F_01;My, that must have been an ordeal to find! Here, this is to thank you for your trouble.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_F_02;Thank you so much again. Here, as a token of our gratitude.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_F_03;My goodness! So this is the Mirage he was talking about... Well, I certainly learned something today. Oh, oh yes, here. Take this. It’s the least I can do.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_G_01;My boy is just delighted that he was finally able to see all the Mirages he’s been dreaming about.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_03_G_02;I do dread what he’ll ask to see next... But when that time comes, I know who to ask for help!
