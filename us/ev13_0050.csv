ev13_0050_0000;Surprising. I never thought the Jiants from the Hills[~]would have so much trouble crossing a desert.
ev13_0050_0001;Oh! So then you’ve heard of us.
ev13_0050_0002;Why are you so happy about that?[~]Trust me, we do [f2]not[/f] want fame.
ev13_0050_0003;This’ll warm you right up.
ev13_0050_0004;Oh. Thanks!
ev13_0050_0005;Thank you kindly.
ev13_0050_0006;Zzzzzz...
ev13_0050_0007;The keys from the prophecy? Interesting...[~]That explains some things.
ev13_0050_0008;So you’ve heard of them?[~]I don’t suppose you can tell us more?
ev13_0050_0009;...There are four:[~]earth, fire, water, and shadow,[~]if I remember correctly.
ev13_0050_0010;You wouldn’t also happen to know[~]where the keys are hidden?
ev13_0050_0011;......
ev13_0050_0012;Is something wrong?
ev13_0050_0013;Oh... Sorry.[~]I’ve never heard exactly where the keys might be hidden.
ev13_0050_0015;But listen—
ev13_0050_0016;I might know something about that.
ev13_0050_0017;Really?
ev13_0050_0018;The Key of Earth...[~]lies in the “cradle of mako’s light.”
ev13_0050_0019;The Key of Tides...[~]that one lies in the “temple in the deep.”
ev13_0050_0020;The Key of Shadows...[~]lies in the “land of naught but night.”
ev13_0050_0021;Ohhh! That sounds nice and specific.
ev13_0050_0022;Wait. Is that from the Crimson Prophecy’s missing verse?
ev13_0050_0023;Yes. You know much, traveler.
ev13_0050_0024;Time out. What is this “missing verse”?
ev13_0050_0025;They say that part of the original prophecy[~]was omitted from subsequent copies.
ev13_0050_0026;However, to be able to read that—
ev13_0050_0027;Oh, I haven’t read it myself.[~]I heard it from someone who has.
ev13_0050_0028;And Bahamut’s castle?[~]You, uh...probably don’t know that much.
ev13_0050_0029;How would she know where [f2]that[/f] is?
ev13_0050_0030;I don’t [f2]know[/f]...but there [f2]are[/f] whispers.
ev13_0050_0031;What?
ev13_0050_0032;Seriously?!
ev13_0050_0033;This is merely a rumor, but...
ev13_0050_0034;they say the castle you seek—the domain of the Heralds and their king—[~]lies past the Crystal Tower, beyond the path of the gods.
ev13_0050_0035;Heralds...[~]So then, the king who founded Bahamut.
ev13_0050_0036;Cool! So, all we have to do is get those four keys,[~]and then haul hiney over to the Crystal Tower, am I right?
ev13_0050_0037;Yeah, from the sound of it...
ev13_0050_0038;......
ev13_0050_0039;*Yaaawwwn* All this reassuring info is making me sleepy.
ev13_0050_0040;*Yaaawwwn* Don’t yawn, Lann.[~]You’re making me yawn too.
ev13_0050_0041;What do you say we just...turn in here for the day...
ev13_0050_0042;Yeah, okay...
ev13_0050_0043;Good night, Reynn...
ev13_0050_0044;Good night...
ev13_0050_0045;......
ev13_0050_0046;Wh...what is...that noise?
ev13_0050_0047;Nnn... Now what...
ev13_0050_0048;Huh?
ev13_0050_0049;Agh?!
ev13_0050_0050;That chain...
ev13_0050_0051;The Federation...[~]What are [f2]they[/f] doing here?
ev13_0050_0052;We were careless...[~]The drinks...last night...
ev13_0050_0053;What? They were—
ev13_0050_0054;Dude, my body... I can barely...
ev13_0050_0055;No heroics, please.
ev13_0050_0056;Agh!
ev13_0050_0057;Hey now. That is certainly no way for us to treat a lady.
ev13_0050_0058;Or as I frequently say, the churl never gets the girl.
ev13_0050_0059;Heh. Rubbish.
ev13_0050_0060;Who’s the knight?
ev13_0050_0061;The Federation. Who else could it be?
ev13_0050_0062;I believe our arrangement...[~]said the Jiants were mine to attend to.
ev13_0050_0063;......
ev13_0050_0064;“Attend to”? That sounds...awfully churlish to me...!
ev13_0050_0065;Ah, but no.[~]See, you may be a Jiant, but my attention...[~]I save for [f2]real[/f] grown-ups.
ev13_0050_0066;That’s it! Nobody talks to her like that!
ev13_0050_0067;Aaagh!
ev13_0050_0068;Lann!
ev13_0050_0069;Aaah!
ev13_0050_0070;Let’s try to keep things civil, if you don’t mind.[~]Please don’t struggle.
ev13_0050_0071;Wh-what is going on?
ev13_0050_0072;I...I don’t know...
ev13_0050_0073;Nngh!
ev13_0050_0074;Aaah!
