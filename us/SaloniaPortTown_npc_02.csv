SaloniaPortTown_npc_02_A_01;Can you believe it? If we raise our civic rank, we can spend the rest of our lives in a castle, wanting for nothing!
SaloniaPortTown_npc_02_A_02;I’ve gotta get cracking on my own rank if I want to be an Architect!
SaloniaPortTown_npc_02_B_01;Things have really taken a turn for the worse lately.
SaloniaPortTown_npc_02_B_02;I hope I become a first-rate Architect soon. Then I’ll be safe and sound in the castle.
SaloniaPortTown_npc_02_C_01;I was this close to becoming an Architect, and now the Federation has gone kaput...
SaloniaPortTown_npc_02_C_02;Ohhh! Now I’ll never get to live in a castle!
