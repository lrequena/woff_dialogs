ev10_0040_0000;Ugh...
ev10_0040_0001;Yay for miracles.
ev10_0040_0002;Now’s our chance to run the-past them!
ev10_0040_0003;Yeah, good i—
ev10_0040_0004;Eep!
ev10_0040_0005;It’s...behind the-me, isn’t it.
ev10_0040_0006;Final...
ev10_0040_0007;Heaven!
ev10_0040_0008;Whoa! It finally worked!
ev10_0040_0009;Oh! I can celebrate later.[~]Come on, this way! Hurry!
ev10_0040_0010;The two of them have started something.[~]Mediums have been awakening one after the next.
ev10_0040_0011;Then you mean the Azure Prophecy...is coming true.
ev10_0040_0012;So what. No matter how many Champions arise,[~]the laws of this world are beyond their power to change.
ev10_0040_0013;The only force that can change those laws[~]is the almighty power of a true king.
ev10_0040_0014;We must fulfill the Crimson Prophecy.[~]And swiftly. Are we agreed?
ev10_0040_0015;Yes.
ev10_0040_0016;Thanks again! You really saved our biscuits the-back there!
ev10_0040_0017;Who knew they came in sets?
ev10_0040_0018;I’m just glad you’re all right.
ev10_0040_0019;Huge dragons live in the Scars. You’re lucky you only ran into the two.
ev10_0040_0020;Normally, people don’t set foot near the place, but I heard all the ruckus and knew something must be up.
ev10_0040_0021;It’s a good thing you did. Gotta say, though, you pack quite a punch!
ev10_0040_0022;Oh. Well...I might’ve gotten lucky.
ev10_0040_0023;Huh?
ev10_0040_0024;That’s actually one of my master’s moves. That was the first time I ever managed to pull it off.
ev10_0040_0025;Oh!
ev10_0040_0026;I live to the north of here, in a town called Nibelheim.
ev10_0040_0027;Come on by, if you get a chance!
