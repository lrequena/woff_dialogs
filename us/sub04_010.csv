sub04_010_0000;Ugh... I guess there’s no point[~]in me dwelling on it now.
sub04_010_0001;Seriously, getting to town and back[~]is a real pain in the neck.
sub04_010_0002;Maybe with some magic...[~]I wonder if I could just build an ice bridge right here.
sub04_010_0003;Hup! Hnnnnnngh!
sub04_010_0004;...Oh yeah.[~]I guess I don’t know how to use Blizzard magic.
sub04_010_0005;Build a bridge?[~]Well, I suppose that it would ease the journey to town, but—[~]ice sounds like a recipe for a broken neck.
sub04_010_0006;You...might have a point there.
sub04_010_0007;Hmm, a bridge of ice... Oh![~]Now hold on. I’ve heard of a Mirage who might[~]be able to make us exactly what we’re looking for.
sub04_010_0008;That would be great!
sub04_010_0009;I think her name was Shiva.[~]She’s said to live somewhere in Cornelia.
sub04_010_0010;Hmm...
sub04_010_0011;Hm? Wait a second. If we build a bridge that leads right to town,[~]then who’s going to stay at the Solace anymore?
sub04_010_0012;I certainly can’t have that...[~]H-hey, Refia! We weren’t done talking this over yet!
sub04_010_0013;Good grief. How’d I let you talk me into coming along?
sub04_010_0014;That’s funny, I thought I told you I could handle it myself.
sub04_010_0015;Hey! Where’s Shiva?![~]Get out here on the double so we can discuss some business!
sub04_010_0016;Ha ha ha ha! You want me to come to you?[~]How about I turn you to ice and hang you up on my wall?
sub04_010_0017;No thank you. Unless you’re hiding some handsome men,[~]then I am done with you now. Good-bye.
sub04_010_0018;We never said we’re done with [f2]you[/f].
sub04_010_0019;Uh, so...we were hoping to ask for a favor.
sub04_010_0020;A favor?
sub04_010_0021;Hmm... A bridge of ice?
sub04_010_0022;Yes. We heard that you were a specialist of sorts.
sub04_010_0023;You must be mistaken.[~]I’m not the one who does the ice bridge trick.
sub04_010_0024;Oh, out of your league? Well, we won’t waste our time with second-tier Mirages.[~]You ready to go, Refia?
sub04_010_0025;Huh?
sub04_010_0026;W-w-w-wait, wait just a minute![~]When did I say that I can’t do it?
sub04_010_0027;I heard what you said. “But, bwidges are the [f2]other[/f] shiva’s job!”[~]Pfft. If you’re too small-time then just say so.
sub04_010_0028;I do not talk like that at all! And you dare to call me [f2]small-time?[/f][~]You...wretched HUMANS!
sub04_010_0029;Wha— Everyone calm down!
