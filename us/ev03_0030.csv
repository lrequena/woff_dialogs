ev03_0030_0000;Uh, what’s this?
ev03_0030_0001;Oh, that’s not the-good.
ev03_0030_0002;This is the-called a “threshold.” Mirages the-create them to mark their territory.
ev03_0030_0003;When you see a threshold, you better watch out, ’cause the Mirages inside are extremely the-powerful.
ev03_0030_0004;And the worst part: if you cross it and lose a fight the-inside, I can’t use my powers to rewind time and extricate you.
ev03_0030_0005;No extri-cation? Guess we’d better be “extra” careful, then! Duh ha ha ha!
ev03_0030_0007;Ugh... Anyway, it sounds like if we’re going in, we’d better go in fully prepared.
ev03_0030_0008;That’s the-for sure. And don’t the-forget to save your progress, too.
