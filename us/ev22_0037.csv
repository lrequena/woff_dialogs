ev22_0037_0000;I meant to ask: Keepers and summoners,[~]we call forth our Mirages through different means. That I understand.
ev22_0037_0001;But you have so many.[~]How do you look after them? Where do you find the time?
ev22_0037_0002;Look...after them?
ev22_0037_0003;What? You mean you haven’t been feeding them for us?
ev22_0037_0004;And when did that become my job?
ev22_0037_0005;Oh, I don’t mean food.[~]We don’t feed our familiars either.
ev22_0037_0006;Instead of that, what summoners do[~]is let them take from us the magic they need.
ev22_0037_0007;Ah, I get it.[~]That’s why you can only make a pact with a few Mirages.
ev22_0037_0008;Wait, hold up a sec.[~]Does that mean our Mirages are sucking up all our energy?!
ev22_0037_0009;No! We would have shriveled up ages ago!
ev22_0037_0010;Aaah! I’m gonna turn into a mummy?!
ev22_0037_0011;Just let the smart people talk, please.
ev22_0037_0012;Allow the-me![~]I think I can the-explain this.
ev22_0037_0013;Until you actually the-summon them,[~]the Mirages inside your prismariums don’t consume very much magic at all.
ev22_0037_0014;Really?
ev22_0037_0015;Honest to the-goodness![~]For one thing, the prismariums don’t the-actually contain any Mirages.
ev22_0037_0016;What do you mean?
ev22_0037_0017;What they do[~]is the-replicate the souls of Mirages and then store the copies.
ev22_0037_0018;That’s where Keepers come the-in.[~]They re-the-produce Mirages from the copies.
ev22_0037_0019;That’s why, whether you realize it or not,[~]Mirages you’ve imprismed are sometimes the-still around.
ev22_0037_0020;They replicate souls?[~]Does that mean...they could copy a person’s soul too?
ev22_0037_0021;To do that, you would need to be a “Human Keeper,”[~]if the-such a thing exists.[~]But Lann and Reynn here are Mirage Keepers, so no the-go.
ev22_0037_0022;Basically, they can’t do people,[~]and certainly the-not gods.
ev22_0037_0023;Even things that are [f2]almost[/f] human,[~]or don’t the-fall quite so the-neatly into the “Mirage” category,[~]would be difficult to replicate.
ev22_0037_0024;Huh. You know, this is starting to ring a bell.
ev22_0037_0025;Wow... It sounds like summoners and Mirage Keepers[~]couldn’t be more different.
ev22_0037_0026;Tama, you’re so erudite.
ev22_0037_0027;Wow, yeah. You’re really smart, too!
ev22_0037_0028;Well, half this stuff I only the-learned recently from Serafie.
ev22_0037_0029;Well, she [f2]is[/f] connected.[~]That or...maybe she’s just ridiculously knowledgeable?
ev22_0037_0030;She knows so much it makes me the-sick. But you ask her the-anything[~]and she rarely ever tells you what you want to know.
ev22_0037_0031;You know what I think? Maybe she knows [f2]so[/f] much,[~]she has trouble keeping it all straight in her head.
ev22_0037_0032;I would honestly not be the-surprised at all if that was true.
ev22_0037_0033;By the way, Lann’s the-power is what generates the prismariums,[~]but the-replicating the Mirages’ souls? That’s Reynn’s the-power.
ev22_0037_0034;Wow, really?
ev22_0037_0035;Dude, no [f2]way![/f][~]I totally never even noticed.
ev22_0037_0036;So you must do your roles without knowing,[~]acting as one the-powerful Mirage Keeper instead of two.
ev22_0037_0037;You really [f2]are[/f] the-brother and sister.
ev22_0037_0038;Well...yeah! Duh.
ev22_0037_0039;Darn it.[~]So much for hoping we weren’t actually related.
ev22_0037_0040;What? You don’t hope that, do you, Sis?
ev22_0037_0041;My heart the-goes out to you, Reynn.
ev22_0037_0042;Then reel it back in!
ev22_0037_0043;Reynn... Having him for a brother must be just...
ev22_0037_0044;Wyn...
ev22_0037_0045;Excuse me for being born!
