ev01_0090_0000;Choco-boco-lina! ...Oh!
ev01_0090_0001;Hello and how are you? Hmm?
ev01_0090_0002;Uh, good. More or less.
ev01_0090_0003;You know, what a nice, quiet place.
ev01_0090_0004;Oh, uh...
ev01_0090_0005;So who are the-you?
ev01_0090_0006;Oh! You can call me Chocolatte.
ev01_0090_0007;I seem to have washed up here[~]like a soggy yellow feather in a storm.
ev01_0090_0008;Huh?
ev01_0090_0009;I do have this funny knack for winding up in strange places.
ev01_0090_0010;Uh, cool...
ev01_0090_0011;Oh, right!
ev01_0090_0012;Care to shop? I’ve got the goods![~]Choco-boco-ching!
ev01_0090_0013;Whoa, slow down![~]What kind of operation is this?
ev01_0090_0014;It’s called a shop, dear.
ev01_0090_0015;You’re in luck! I find all kinds of stuff[~]as I bounce from point A to point Q.[~]I’m your choco-connection!
