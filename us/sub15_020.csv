sub15_020_0009;I don’t think I’ve ever seen her this happy before...
sub15_020_0010;I’d have to the-agree with that.
sub15_020_0011;So by the way, what do you want with my train’s blueprints?[~]They can’t be useful to you.

sub15_020_0015;Can you really do that?
sub15_020_0016;Please. I’ve been a Mirage conductor for fifty years![~]Hooking one lousy train is gonna be a piece of cactus. So to speak.
sub15_020_0017;Great! We’ll tell the League of S and Celes.
