sub30_040_0000;What’s this?
sub30_040_0001;Just a dream. A very bad one.
sub30_040_0002;Shelke...
sub30_040_0003;Huh? Brother...?
sub30_040_0004;Yes, that’s right.[~]I’ve been searching for so long.
sub30_040_0005;...For me?
sub30_040_0006;Of course. You know, when I first heard the news—[~]how you’d fled after becoming an Architect—I was so worried.
sub30_040_0007;You came after me? But...you had it all.[~]You were the exceptional one.
sub30_040_0008;I know that...Mom and Dad pressured you into it.[~]Becoming an Architect.
sub30_040_0009;What’s wrong? You can tell me.
sub30_040_0010;After you left and went to the cathedral...[~]the house got so...unbearable...
sub30_040_0011;We tried, but we couldn’t reach you.[~]Mom became sick with worry.
sub30_040_0012;And Dad...just hid in his bottle.[~]The fire broke out...and then they were gone.
sub30_040_0013;What choice did I have?[~]The cathedral was the only place I...I could think to go to...
sub30_040_0014;So then you’re telling me...you killed Mom and Dad.
sub30_040_0015;What? No!
sub30_040_0016;You put them in the ground.
sub30_040_0017;You were always making trouble for them.[~]You never did them an ounce of good.
sub30_040_0018;You grew tired of their scolding, so one day...[~]you made them burn.
sub30_040_0019;No! I would never do someth—
sub30_040_0020;But you did.
sub30_040_0021;You’re saying...that I...
sub30_040_0022;Yes. And now that Mom and Dad are no more, my job...[~]is to see you punished.
sub30_040_0023;You want me...to atone?[~]For what I...did to them?
sub30_040_0024;I want...you dead.
