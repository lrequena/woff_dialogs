ev01_0016_0001;First, you’re the-going to need this!
ev01_0016_0002;It looks sort of like a prismarium. What is it?
ev01_0016_0003;That’s the-called a “prism.”[~]Use it to the-make the chocochick’s prismarium!
ev01_0016_0004;Every time you find a new the-Mirage you haven’t seen before,[~]it’ll be recorded in Enna Kros’s special Mirage Manual.
