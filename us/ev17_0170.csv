ev17_0170_0002;By the bye, do you buy into this so-called “Crimson” Prophecy?
ev17_0170_0003;Um... You have to keep in mind that we remember almost nothing about Grymoire. Azure, Crimson—[f2]all[/f] this prophecy stuff—it just sounds like jibber-jabber to us.
ev17_0170_0004;Yuh-huh! This is my first the-time in Grymoire too, so I don’t get it the-either.
ev17_0170_0005;Yup! Sails over [f2]my[/f] head.
ev17_0170_0006;Yeah, well, Lann, entire [f2]navies[/f] sail over your head.
ev17_0170_0007;I suppose that it’s fine as long as you’re taking it with a grain of salt, but do allow me to add a word of caution.
ev17_0170_0008;You see, while this library contains every ancient book you can imagine, not one of them mentions anything about a Crimson Prophecy.
ev17_0170_0009;Wow... So even with all these books, you’re still missing one?
ev17_0170_0010;Nnno. Anything old enough to be called a proper prophecy would have to be in our archives.
ev17_0170_0011;Huh? Then why isn’t it?
ev17_0170_0012;Indeed. I’m certain there’s a good explanation...which we just aren’t thinking of.
