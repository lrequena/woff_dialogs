sub14_015_0001;I don’t know, but everything from its HP to its, um,[~][f2]everything[/f] is the-right off the scale!
sub14_015_0002;Every one of its stats is right off the charts.[~]We’re talking baaad news.
sub14_015_0003;Have we even got a shot at this thing?
sub14_015_0004;Fortunately, it seems like its healing abilities are the-limited.
sub14_015_0005;The good news is, its healing speed appears to be very slow.
sub14_015_0006;So then, we shouldn’t expect to take it down in one shot.
sub14_015_0007;Huh? Wait...[~]What do you mean?
sub14_015_0008;I mean, we fight it as many times as it takes!
sub14_015_0009;Dude! That...means we have to live through the first time.
sub14_015_0010;The battle continues...
