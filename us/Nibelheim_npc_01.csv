Nibelheim_npc_01_A_01;Welcome to Nibelheim! It’s thanks to Shinra that this town has come so far.
Nibelheim_npc_01_A_02;You see, Shinra uses volcanic energy in order to generate power.
Nibelheim_npc_01_B_01;Do you think that maybe those machines could be Mirages?
Nibelheim_npc_01_B_02;Thank goodness we’ve got the SOLDIERs here looking out for us. I shudder to think where we’d be without them.
Nibelheim_npc_01_C_01;It’s all thanks to Shinra that we’re alive and safe!
Nibelheim_npc_01_C_02;Ahh! Aren’t SOLDIERs just the best?
