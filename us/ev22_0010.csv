ev22_0010_0000_2;[s40]Turn Those Corners Up[/s]
ev22_0010_0001;No!
ev22_0010_0002;You will not accept this?
ev22_0010_0003;It was your doing. Yours.[~]And now you would refuse to accept the consequences?
ev22_0010_0004;Accept it?[~]How could you expect me to accept it?!
ev22_0010_0005;Lann takes the fall, while I cower in my fake world?!
ev22_0010_0006;I mean, this is my fault as much as it is his![~]He shouldn’t have to pay my share!
ev22_0010_0007;Who do I tell I’m sorry?[~]Our mom and dad?!
ev22_0010_0008;Then I will ask you again.[~]Will you, or will you not accept the consequences?
ev22_0010_0009;I will not. Not these!
ev22_0010_0010;Very well.
ev22_0010_0011;I shall yield to you all nine of my precious lives...
ev22_0010_0012;and give you a chance to continue your tale differently...[~]and weave the threads of time anew.
ev22_0010_0013;Tick, tock... Tick, tock...
ev22_0010_0014;Life sacrifice acknowledged.[~]Now time shall be threaded anew.
ev22_0010_0015;Bong... Bong...
ev22_0010_0016;Huh?
ev22_0010_0017;All right! Let’s kick some Baha-butt,[~]and give this world a saving it won’t forget!
ev22_0010_0018;After all, if we really did cause all of this mess...[~]it’s about time that we settled up.
ev22_0010_0019;Wait!
ev22_0010_0020;Huh?! Wh-what’s gotten into you?
ev22_0010_0021;Just...wait...
ev22_0010_0022;Wh-where’s Tama?
ev22_0010_0023;Tomma? What’s that?
ev22_0010_0024;Our...friend...

ev22_0010_0025_1;NOT USED
ev22_0010_0026;NOT USED
ev22_0010_0027;No way...[~]Was that her back there? That was Tama?
ev22_0010_0028;Uh, hey, Lann.[~]You really don’t know who I mean?
ev22_0010_0029;Tama's our friend.[~]This whole journey, she’s been by our side!
ev22_0010_0030;What? I have [f2]no[/f] idea what you’re saying.[~]What is wrong with you? You’re acting so weird.
ev22_0010_0031;Well, I’ve never seen her behave like this. Usually Lann’s the one[~]who acts like he got punched in the back of the head.
ev22_0010_0032;Ah! S-Serafie?[~]But you...[f2]you[/f] can’t be here.
ev22_0010_0033;Heh?
ev22_0010_0034;What? Why would you freak out about Serafie?
ev22_0010_0035;C’mon, [f2]she’s[/f] the one who’s been by our side![~]Seriously, do you wanna rest a sec?
ev22_0010_0036;Serafie. You [f2]know[/f] her. You love Tama!
ev22_0010_0037;Someone named “Tama”?
ev22_0010_0038;Wait, I think I’ve got it.[~]Could it be short for “Tamamohimé”?
ev22_0010_0039;I have no idea where you might have heard the name,[~]but it sure does take me back to the old days.
ev22_0010_0040;All right, I don’t know what you’re up to,[~]but I’m going up there to kick some Baha-butt!
ev22_0010_0041;No!
ev22_0010_0042;Huh?
ev22_0010_0043;......
ev22_0010_0044;[f2]Careful. Tama gave her lives for this chance.[~]It’s a new timeline. I can’t waste it.[/f]
ev22_0010_0045;We’re not ready to do this.
ev22_0010_0046;But, why not?
ev22_0010_0047;Lann, think about it. Why did we come here in the first place?[~]You remember? What’d we say we were gonna do?
ev22_0010_0048;What is this, a pop quiz?
ev22_0010_0049;Answer the question.
ev22_0010_0050;Well, if you mean the [f2]first [/f]reason...
ev22_0010_0051;Umm... Enna Kros told us that[~]if we got back all of the Mirages we lost...
ev22_0010_0052;then we might regain our memories,[~]and maybe meet our family. Right?
ev22_0010_0053;That’s right. Taking down the Federation—[~]that wasn’t in the plan.
ev22_0010_0054;Well, of course it wasn’t.[~]We didn’t even know they existed yet.
ev22_0010_0055;And anyway, you and me are the ones who[~]brought those Cogna things into Grymoire. It’s our mess to clean up...
ev22_0010_0056;Even if it means fighting Mom and Dad,[~]and having to sacrifice your life in the end?
ev22_0010_0057;Dude, what? You really [f2]have[/f] lost it.
ev22_0010_0058;Lann. Defeating those guys—[~]it won’t save the world. No good will come of it.
ev22_0010_0059;What happens to us—to you...!
ev22_0010_0060;Would you stop getting so worked up?[~]You’re not making any sense.
ev22_0010_0061;The Cogna. We’ll stop them.
ev22_0010_0062;Huh? Well, yeah, we can do that too,[~]but since we’re here, let’s fight [f2]these[/f] guys!
ev22_0010_0063;I told you that won’t work. It’s pointless.
ev22_0010_0064;First, we need to close the portal.
ev22_0010_0065;Which means collecting more Mirages,[~]more getting stronger...
ev22_0010_0066;[f2]And more owning up to what we’ve done.[/f]
ev22_0010_0067;Hellooo! Reynn?
ev22_0010_0068;Mom... Dad...
ev22_0010_0069;......
ev22_0010_0070;We have to straighten things out with Wyn too.[~]And then...
ev22_0010_0071;Oh-kay, I think it’s time that we—
ev22_0010_0072;We’ll gather Mirages, get stronger,[~]and close that portal!
ev22_0010_0073;You can kick their butts[~][f2]after[/f] we do all that.
ev22_0010_0074;Wh— Hold your chocobos![~]Don’t forget people are losing their souls!
ev22_0010_0075;Yes! So let’s hurry.[~]Mirage collecting and the portal.
ev22_0010_0076;Oh! And we have to call Wyn back from the castle!
ev22_0010_0077;Hey Serafie,[~]do you know anything about that Mirage that Wyn summons?
ev22_0010_0078;Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess.
ev22_0010_0079;That’d be none other than Siren.[~]She comes from the same world of wind pixies that I do.
ev22_0010_0080;You and her are both from the same world?
ev22_0010_0081;Well, then can you contact her[~]and see if she’s with Wyn?
ev22_0010_0082;As long as she’s somewhere in Grymoire,[~]then I’d say it’s doable.
ev22_0010_0083;Great. Would you?
ev22_0010_0084;Okity dokity.[~]Be back in a micro-megaflash.
ev22_0010_0085;Oh, wait!
ev22_0010_0086;Also...tell her we’re sorry for what we did—[~]trapping her for so long. Will you?
ev22_0010_0087;I know that sorry’s not enough, but...
ev22_0010_0088;Yeah, yeah. You’re the boss, boss.
ev22_0010_0089;Reynn...what’s up?[~]You [f2]know[/f] something.
ev22_0010_0090;I’ll try to explain.
ev22_0010_0091;But on the way.[~]We’re going to Balamb Garden.
ev22_0010_0092;Just give it time. I’m positive that Wyn will show up.
