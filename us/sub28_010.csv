sub28_010_0000;That’s Alexander’s voice.[~]What could be wrong?
sub28_010_0001;Tell me, when and where were you born?
sub28_010_0002;Ohhh. So then you [f2]are[/f] from the same place as me.
sub28_010_0003;Whoooa, wait, I know you! Come to think of it,[~]even back then you used to tower over everyone else.
sub28_010_0004;You don’t remember?
sub28_010_0005;You came and challenged me[~]so you could be next in line for the throne.
sub28_010_0006;But of course, my mother’s chains didn’t stop me from winning—[~]I toppled you even though you were hundreds of times bigger.
sub28_010_0007;What a state we left that part of the palace in![~]They were cleaning that mess up for quite a while.
sub28_010_0008;Haha! Well, don’t sound so surprised.
sub28_010_0009;You know, this world you’re in is a part of me.
sub28_010_0010;Oh, now I see. The summoner who brought you here[~]so long ago was similar to Lann and Reynn—[~]someone who had inherited some of my power.
sub28_010_0011;The bloodline of Grymoire’s first summoner has been so busy. Those Farnas![~]There are so many like you in this world now.
sub28_010_0012;There’s Eden of Balamb,[~]then there’s the Lute of Ragnarok, the Midgardian Ormr...
sub28_010_0013;There’s you, of course.[~]And who else...
sub28_010_0014;Hm? What do I want with you?
sub28_010_0015;Actually, I’m not here to see you.[~]I’m here for the one hiding in you...
sub28_010_0016;You there. Show yourself!
sub28_010_0017;Distressing...[~]I see you’re making yourselves at home over there.
sub28_010_0018;Oh well. Champions will show up there in due time.[~]Just like they have here in Grymoire...
sub28_010_0019;Lann! Reynn!
sub28_010_0020;Huh?!
sub28_010_0021;D’ah! Wh-wh-wh-what the?!
sub28_010_0022;’Kay! It’s all yours now.
sub28_010_0023;Wait, all of [f2]what[/f] is?
sub28_010_0024;It’s the-good to see you again!
sub28_010_0025;Hi there, Tama! So, it feels like it’s been a long time for you?
sub28_010_0026;It sure the-does!
sub28_010_0027;E...Enna Kros?![~]But, how can... When did you...
sub28_010_0028;Wh-what is [f2]that[/f] thing?!
sub28_010_0029;I guess it must be[~]the most powerful Cogna in Grymoire right now.
sub28_010_0030;You don’t even know?!
sub28_010_0031;This world looks to the two of you as its saviors now.[~]Go make us proud.
sub28_010_0032;Okay Tama![~]You can go ahead and take it from here.
sub28_010_0033;Roger the-dodger that![~]See you the-real soon!
sub28_010_0034;But what are we [f2]doing?![/f]
sub28_010_0035;Hey! L-Lann, heads up!
