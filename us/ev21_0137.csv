ev21_0137_0000;Please...the-promise me...you’ll be the-careful...
ev21_0137_0001;Huff...huff...
ev21_0137_0002;Tama? What’s wrong? Are you okay?
ev21_0137_0003;Their threshold is just way too the-strong...[~]Like they’re invalidating...my the-existence...
ev21_0137_0004;They must...really the-hate me...
ev21_0137_0005;I can’t bear to see you in pain.[~]Please, go back.
ev21_0137_0006;Huh? But, I can’t go the-back—[~]the three of us are a team!
ev21_0137_0007;Enna Kros told me to...the-look after you...
ev21_0137_0008;Well, you'll be here in spirit, and that’s what counts.[~]We’ll call you if we get into trouble.
ev21_0137_0009;Please? For us, ’kay?
ev21_0137_0010;Ohhh...all the-right. But stay on the-guard.[~]You still...have no idea who you’re...the-dealing with...
ev21_0137_0011;Hey, we can handle ’em. I mean, come on.[~]We’ve held our own against almost everything we’ve faced.
ev21_0137_0011_1;......
ev21_0137_0012;Right, and don’t forget, he’s got me![~]We’ll be fine.
ev21_0137_0013;All right, if [f2]you’re [/f]the-with him.
ev21_0137_0014;What, I’m no good on my own?
ev21_0137_0015;That goes without the-saying.
ev21_0137_0016;Dude! Ouch!
ev21_0137_0017;Okay. Well, if you’re sure, I guess I’ll head the-back.[~]See you soon, all the-right?
ev21_0137_0018;Yup. You know it!
ev21_0137_0019;Bye!
ev21_0137_0020;So! The final leg.[~]Lann, you ready?
ev21_0137_0021;Yeah. Let’s thrash those Heralds,[~]so we can finally go home.
ev21_0137_0022;Right!
