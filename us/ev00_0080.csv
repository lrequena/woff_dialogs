ev00_0080_0000;There, just beyond this light,[~]lies another world called “Grymoire.”
ev00_0080_0001;That...is where you’ll find all the Mirages you’ve lost.
ev00_0080_0002;You mean they’re all inside this gate?
ev00_0080_0003;You got it. Are you ready to conquer them again?
ev00_0080_0004;So, um, if we do manage to find all the lost Mirages...[~]does that mean we’ll be able to remember the things we forgot?
ev00_0080_0005;Well, I don’t know about that.[~]After all, you [f2]lost [/f]your memories.[~]It’s not the same thing as forgetting them.
ev00_0080_0006;Oh...
ev00_0080_0007;But, even if you don’t remember Grymoire,[~]Grymoire still knows a lot about you.
ev00_0080_0008;You’re certain to find traces and records of your past.
ev00_0080_0009;Okay...so, like...
ev00_0080_0010;You’re saying, whether we remember anything[~]about ourselves or not, we can still find clues[~]about our past and the things we’ve done?
ev00_0080_0011;Correct. And if you keep on gathering Mirages,[~]I think you might even meet your family in due time.
ev00_0080_0012;Our family?
ev00_0080_0013;Huh? Well I guess, it does make sense[~]that we’d have parents.
ev00_0080_0014;Oh yes. So then... You going? You going?[~]Will you journey to Grymoire?
