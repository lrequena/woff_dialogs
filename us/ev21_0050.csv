ev21_0050_0000;Eeeeee...
ev21_0050_0001;Wh...what is all this stuff?
ev21_0050_0002;......!
ev21_0050_0003;Tell me, what of the soul crystal?[~]How much of the populace have we harvested?
ev21_0050_0004;If I had to offer up a guess,[~]then just about four souls in every ten.
ev21_0050_0005;No way. The Architects... Were they...
ev21_0050_0006;All this is the true face of the Federation.
ev21_0050_0007;I already knew that I didn’t like them,[~]but this just turns my stomach.
ev21_0050_0008;The Architects are making the world better.
ev21_0050_0009;It’s true—if you’re the Federation.[~]That’s exactly what they do.
ev21_0050_0010;The Architects can live the remainder of their lives in peace,[~]and never want for food.
ev21_0050_0011;Yes, the moment their souls turn to crystal,[~]and ascend to Bahamut’s castle, their wish becomes reality,
ev21_0050_0012;since crystals don’t fight or eat.
ev21_0050_0013;As for work, all they are required to do is become energy.[~]And so they get their life of leisure as well.
ev21_0050_0014;So what, everyone should be happy?![~]Gimme a break!
ev21_0050_0015;Lann is the-right![~]This is—this is completely the-messed up!
ev21_0050_0016;Shelke, did you know about it?
ev21_0050_0017;I did. In fact, I was put in a cathedral.
ev21_0050_0018;Dude...what?
ev21_0050_0019;At first, I believed what they said,[~]and became an Architect.
ev21_0050_0020;I was admitted to a cathedral...[~]and I nearly had my soul crystallized.
ev21_0050_0021;But by sheer coincidence, an accident halted the system,[~]and I managed to escape.
ev21_0050_0022;Later, Shinra took me in, battered, broken soul and all.[~]They helped me.
ev21_0050_0023;When we learned the truth, we knew we had to act,[~]and that’s how the anti-Federation resistance got started.
ev21_0050_0024;Still, until the world fell into chaos, this—[~]breaking into a cathedral—was out of the question.
ev21_0050_0025;But now we know.[~]These are the entrances to our enemy’s castle.
ev21_0050_0026;Really?
ev21_0050_0027;You mean...the chains.[~]They’re the way. They deliver all of the crystal.
ev21_0050_0028;Correct. Once the Architects’ souls have been crystallized,[~]the chains conduct them all the way up to the castle.
ev21_0050_0029;But, but, how are [f2]we[/f] the-supposed[~]to take the chain all the way to the top?
ev21_0050_0030;Well, if you’re human...[~]it sounds like you have to be a Jiant to use the chain.
ev21_0050_0031;Huh?
ev21_0050_0032;Hauyn explained how it works.[~]You see, she took the Chainroad when she went to the castle.
ev21_0050_0033;She’s up there?
ev21_0050_0034;She said the road was designed for the Bahamutian Army.[~]You need to be both a Jiant and a Mirage user in order to traverse it.
ev21_0050_0035;So...
ev21_0050_0036;Right. It’s gotta be us.
ev21_0050_0037;What?
ev21_0050_0038;Reynn, c’mon. If we’re the only ones who can go,[~]then there’s no room for debate here.
ev21_0050_0039;Yeah...I know...
ev21_0050_0040;All right! Let’s kick some Baha-butt,[~]and give this world a saving it won’t forget!
ev21_0050_0041;After all, if we really did cause all of this mess...[~]it’s about time that we settled up.
