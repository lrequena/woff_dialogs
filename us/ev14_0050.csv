ev14_0050_0000;No... I won’t—
ev14_0050_0001;I can’t believe...this is it...
ev14_0050_0002;Thunder!
ev14_0050_0003;You the Jiants from the Hills?
ev14_0050_0004;Hmm? Are you okay?
ev14_0050_0005;Oh! Yes. I’m fine. Thank you.
ev14_0050_0006;Uh, I’m okay too.[~]Talk about close calls.
ev14_0050_0007;A little [f2]too[/f] close.[~]I’m Squall.
ev14_0050_0008;First...
ev14_0050_0009;What’s this?
ev14_0050_0010;A box?
ev14_0050_0011;Sort of. It’s an eldbox, a kind of artifact...[~]with some modern improvements.
ev14_0050_0012;You might say it’s kind of like...those things[~]that you Keepers use to contain Mirages.
ev14_0050_0013;Huh? You mean prismariums?
ev14_0050_0014;Aha. Is [f2]that[/f] what you call ’em?
ev14_0050_0015;Sure, you can just think of it[~]like a prismarium.
ev14_0050_0016;The only difference is that eldboxes[~]are for capturing machines, and not Mirages.
ev14_0050_0017;Capture them?
ev14_0050_0018;Give it a try.
ev14_0050_0019;Whoa! Too cool!
ev14_0050_0020;Squall, whose side are you on?[~]I don’t get why you’d help us.
ev14_0050_0030;I’ll tell you on the way,[~]but we need to go.
