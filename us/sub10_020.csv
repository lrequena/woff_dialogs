sub10_020_0000;Whew! We did it, Boko![~]But I don’t get it. What was that chocobo’s problem?
sub10_020_0001;Kweeeh.
sub10_020_0002;Okay guys, you’re free to go.
sub10_020_0003;Oh. Who’re you?
sub10_020_0004;Choco-boco-LINA! Oh, I’m, uh,[~]just a regular old passerby, plain as they come!
sub10_020_0005;I have to say, you are [f2]really[/f] something![~]It takes one tough hombre to handle Hyperion!
sub10_020_0006;And I suppose Hyperion...[~]must be that black chocobo from before?
sub10_020_0007;I tell ya, that thing was more behemoth than chocobo.[~]And it’s not often that Boko gets openly hostile toward anything.
sub10_020_0008;Oh! And by Boko, I mean this fella.[~]I’m Bartz! And you are?
sub10_020_0009;My name is Chocolatte.
sub10_020_0010;I can see Boko is very smart.[~]That, and he seems to have the same keen senses as my master.
sub10_020_0011;Master?
sub10_020_0012;Hmmm... Say, Bartz.[~]If you’re planning a long journey, why don’t you visit my shop before you go?
sub10_020_0013;I carry just the kind of items an enterprising adventurer needs![~]And I want to ask you more about those chocobos, too.
sub10_020_0014;Wow, you should have said that you run your own shop![~]Sure, we’ll take you up on the offer. Right, Boko?
sub10_020_0015;Kweh!
sub10_020_0016;Oh, perfect. Right this way.[~]Choco-boco-ching!
sub10_020_0017;So I meant to ask: why are you able to understand what Boko says?
sub10_020_0018;Ha ha! Me and Boko just have a special connection!
sub10_020_0019;Kweh kweh!
