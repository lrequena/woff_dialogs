ev11_0080_0000;No! Stay away!
ev11_0080_0001;Whoa!
ev11_0080_0002;Rydia! Are you okay?
ev11_0080_0003;Ugh...
ev11_0080_0004;I...I hate fire. More than anything.
ev11_0080_0005;Long ago, the Federation decided to invade my home.
ev11_0080_0006;The house I was in caught fire...[~]I was all alone, and I...
ev11_0080_0007;Then why’d you come to a place like this?
ev11_0080_0008;You needed someone to help you, didn’t you?[~]I wanted to conquer my fears!
ev11_0080_0009;But...I couldn’t do it.[~]The mere sight of so much fire... It was...
ev11_0080_0010;Well, I’d say you did pretty great!
ev11_0080_0011;Yeah, I mean, that fire Mirage?[~]You doused it in one fell swoop!
ev11_0080_0012;Right? You’ve got [f2]nothing[/f] to be scared of.
ev11_0080_0013;Fire got you down?[~]All you gotta do then is just blow it out, baby.
ev11_0080_0014;“Blow it out, baby”? That’s your sage advice?[~]She’s not struggling with a fear of birthday cakes.
ev11_0080_0015;She’s not?
ev11_0080_0016;No, dude.
ev11_0080_0017;Then... Oh! How ’bout this?[~]Maybe she needs a party to cheer her up!
ev11_0080_0019;What about [f2]anything[/f] that you're doing[~]right now could possibly cheer her up?
ev11_0080_0020;Oh wait, are you trying to make fire look cool?
ev11_0080_0021;It's the-cooler than [f2]you.[/f]
ev11_0080_0022;Hee hee! Ha ha ha!
ev11_0080_0023;You’re so weird. Heh heh!
ev11_0080_0024;Huh? I am not!
ev11_0080_0025;Yeah, you’re way past weird.
ev11_0080_0026;Completely beyond the-redemption.
ev11_0080_0027;Heeey.
ev11_0080_0028;Ha ha! So, shall we?
ev11_0080_0029;Wh-what? But Rydia!
ev11_0080_0030;Go home. You’ve got nothing to prove.[~]We’ll let you know if we find anything.
ev11_0080_0031;Really? How will you get past that wall of fire?
ev11_0080_0032;Oh, uh...
ev11_0080_0033;Look. I’ll return to Nibelheim[~][f2]after[/f] I put the fire out for you.
ev11_0080_0034;Sound reasonable?
ev11_0080_0035;Yeah! Reasonlicious.
ev11_0080_0036;You’re sure?
ev11_0080_0037;Yes. Come on.
