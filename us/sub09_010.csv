sub09_010_0000;What dire circumstances...[~]I'm going to need [f2]both[/f] their help.
sub09_010_0001;Hey! Your tickets, please!
sub09_010_0002;Guess who’s come to rescue you, kupo!
sub09_010_0003;And I knew that you would...my old friends.
sub09_010_0004;So, let’s hear it.[~]What’s wrong, Tondawg?
sub09_010_0005;Oh—
sub09_010_0006;Hm? Did I just hear you refer to me as “Tondawg”?
sub09_010_0007;What’s the sit-rep, kupo? Tonnypoo!
sub09_010_0008;Wait. What is this?[~]Since when have you called me such ghastly names?
sub09_010_0009;“Since when,” he says.[~]Listen to you! We just started now!
sub09_010_0010;Don’t you know? The best of friends[~]always give each other fun nicknames, kupo![~]That’s what we are, kupo! Tonbro!
sub09_010_0011;Now hold on. I don’t even know where to begin.[~]I mean, let’s say I called [f2]you[/f] two...
sub09_010_0012;“Cactoodle! Moogiepie!”[~]Can you imagine it? You’d die of shame.
sub09_010_0013;Not at all, Tonbuddy!
sub09_010_0014;I love it, kupo! Tonchops!
sub09_010_0015;Ugh... You win. Call me whatever you want.[~]As long as they’re not the kind of nickname that you have to squeak.
sub09_010_0016;Ohhh. What a pickle.
sub09_010_0017;So this coliseum, which hides within a strange and mysterious mist[~]that can connect it to whole other worlds...
sub09_010_0018;...Was suddenly struck by an unexpected and chaotic phenomenon[~]that caused a bunch of Mirages to run amok. Right, kupo?
sub09_010_0019;...Thank you for the exposition.
sub09_010_0020;So now that you know the problem,[~]I would very much appreciate your assistance.
sub09_010_0021;......
sub09_010_0022;......
sub09_010_0023;Hm? All right then?
sub09_010_0024;......
sub09_010_0025;......
sub09_010_0026;Ugh... C-Cactoodle! Moogiepie!
sub09_010_0027;Woo-hoo-hoo! Count me in![~]Everything’s going to be peachy keen!
sub09_010_0028;Darn tootin’, kupo! Friends stick together, kupo!
sub09_010_0029;Uh, yes. Um, thank you.
