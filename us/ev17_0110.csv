ev17_0110_0001;Huh?!

ev17_0110_0003;I just...[~]I think I saw somebody inside of that train.
ev17_0110_0004;Y-you are so full of elixirs.

ev17_0110_0016;Not again... Me and trains...[~]We are [f2]so[/f] not getting along lately.
ev17_0110_0017;Oh! Speaking of, do you know the difference[~]between a train and a tram?
