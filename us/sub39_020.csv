sub39_020_0000;Where am I?
sub39_020_0001;What are you doing?
sub39_020_0002;That girl has already made her decision.[~]What gives you the right to stand between her and her choices?
sub39_020_0003;And who are you?
sub39_020_0004;Do you respect her resolve so little[~]you would trample all over it?
sub39_020_0005;No, it’s not that.
sub39_020_0006;But you know exactly why she made the choice she did—[~]you accepted it and allowed her to go.[~]You agreed that small sacrifices must be made for the good of the many.
sub39_020_0007;I’ll admit...I did try to convince myself of that.[~]And I almost let myself believe it.
sub39_020_0008;But no... What’s wrong is wrong!
sub39_020_0009;A world of loss, of sacrifice...[~]I won’t have it!
sub39_020_0010;My choice...is to look for a better choice!
sub39_020_0011;Then prove to me that you can endure![~]Do you really think you possess the strength to shield the world from tragedy?[~]I shall be the judge of that!
sub39_020_0012;You have proven the depth of your resolve.[~]I offer you all of my power. Wield it now as you see fit.
sub39_020_0013;Don’t do this!
sub39_020_0014;Yuna?
sub39_020_0015;No one should have to sacrifice herself for others.[~]It’s wrong. I won’t allow it!
sub39_020_0016;No more!
