sub41_010_0000;Don’t worry, Yuna. You’ll be fine as long as I’m here![~]That Mirage—it’s Bismarck, right? I can take him.
sub41_010_0001;Uh... Thank you. But, we’re here to fight him together.[~]You don’t have to “take him” alone.
sub41_010_0002;You got it![~]So, is it me, or do we [f2]have[/f] somethin’ here?
sub41_010_0003;Like we’re...soulmates! Wouldn’t you say?
sub41_010_0004;U-ugh. This is no time for silly jokes.[~]We need to focus on the battle that lies before us.
sub41_010_0005;Ha ha! Okay, you’re right, I’m sorry.[~]I just wanna help us relax. Loosen up before the big fight.
sub41_010_0006;Right, let’s roll out!
sub41_010_0007;From what Quistis was telling us,[~]Bismarck should still be somewhere in this area.
sub41_010_0008;So hey, if I remember right,[~]don’t they call Bismarck the “shining demon”?
sub41_010_0009;Seems kinda weird. “Shining” doesn’t sound threatening.
sub41_010_0010;Like, between Shining Yuna and Shady Yuna,[~]Shady Yuna sounds [f2]bad[/f], but SHINING Yuna sounds cool.
sub41_010_0011;Tidus. Let’s save the analysis for later.[~]Right now, we need a plan in case things go wrong.
sub41_010_0012;Say...we fail to defeat Bismarck.[~]Valefor and I will create a diversion so that you can—
sub41_010_0013;Hey, hold up. What “say”...we maybe think some happier thoughts?
sub41_010_0014;There’s nothing wrong with being prepared for the worst.[~]But, I promise you: on my honor as a summoner, I will keep you safe.
sub41_010_0015;Come on now, Yuna.[~]I’m glad you’re lookin’ out for me. I am!
sub41_010_0016;But, can’t you at least let me [f2]pretend[/f] like I’m helping?[~]See, there’s this thing about guys.
sub41_010_0017;Huh? Wh-what “thing about guys”?[~]A-actually, I think I’d just as soon not know—
sub41_010_0018;A good summoner has to know people to help people![~]Right? Guys are like half the population.[~]You don’t want to be fifty percent summoner, do ya?
sub41_010_0019;Well...that’s fair. So if I understand you correctly,[~]then learning about men is...an education.
sub41_010_0020;That’s right!
sub41_010_0021;I don’t wanna scare you with all our deep and complicated emotions, [f2]so[/f],[~]let me just give you the broader points. Number one...
sub41_010_0022;We like to flirt!
sub41_010_0023;Ugh... I [f2]knew[/f] that you weren’t taking this seriously!
sub41_010_0024;Aha ha! But you were taking it [f2]so[/f] seriously that I couldn’t help it!
sub41_010_0025;...Ha ha! Okay.[~]I’ll admit, you did get me to relax.
sub41_010_0026;There! That’s more like it.[~]If you don’t enjoy yourself, then what’s the point of goin’ on a quest?
sub41_010_0027;Oh hey, check this out. You ever whistle?
sub41_010_0028;(WHISTLE through his fingers)
sub41_010_0029;That’s wonderful! A sound that clear could cut through anything...[~]Wait, that’s perfect!
sub41_010_0030;Huh?
sub41_010_0031;If we ever get separated,[~]you can just whistle to signal for help!
sub41_010_0032;Okay? And then I’ll come running.
sub41_010_0033;Ugh... You know, you seem real set[~]on coming to [f2]somebody’s[/f] rescue before this day is over.
sub41_010_0034;So, now [f2]you[/f] whistle.
sub41_010_0035;Okay...
sub41_010_0036;(BREATH, then FINGER WHISTLE FAIL)
sub41_010_0037;Uh... That’s okay! I won’t need it.[~]I never ask others for help.
sub41_010_0038;Why not? So you’re a summoner. So what?[~]There’s no shame in asking for help when you need it!
sub41_010_0039;Tidus, you’ve already been there for me once when it mattered the most.
sub41_010_0040;Then let me be there again![~]It’s not like anyone’s keeping score.
sub41_010_0041;Why is it that...you’re so...
sub41_010_0042;Oop! We got company!
