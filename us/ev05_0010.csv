ev05_0010_0000_2;[s40]The Champion Who Saved Grymoire[/s]
ev05_0010_0001;From the looks of the-it, the Bahamutian encampment[~]is going to stay a goblin the-hangout for good.
ev05_0010_0002;At least they’ll leave Cornelia alone for a while,[~]now that we’ve gotten rid of the soldier controlling them.
ev05_0010_0003;Once Mirages are scattered and separated from their keeper,[~]they revert to their wild state.
ev05_0010_0004;And wild Mirages are something you just...[~]learn to get used to in Grymoire.
ev05_0010_0005;That’s why you’ve got Mr. Warrior here.
ev05_0010_0006;Yes indeed.
ev05_0010_0007;However, we cannot rule out the possibility[~]of another Bahamut attack.
ev05_0010_0008;What we need...is an alliance with another country.[~]Some sort of mutual agreement[~]to come to each other’s defense.
ev05_0010_0009;Actually, word has been spreading of such an organization:[~]an anti-Federation group as large as a nation.
ev05_0010_0010;Perhaps the time has come to formally introduce ourselves.[~]They call themselves the League of S.
ev05_0010_0011;“League of S”? Do you know of any way to reach them?
ev05_0010_0012;The thane of Saronia to the north has been in contact with them.[~]I believe one of the merchants mentioned it.
ev05_0010_0013;Saronia, yes.[~]They [f2]have[/f] been resisting Federation annexation.
ev05_0010_0014;Yes. Highness, allow me to journey there,[~]and learn what I can about the League of S.
ev05_0010_0015;Alone? To get to Saronia,[~]you must pass through all manner of places[~]teeming with dangerous Mirages. And I...
ev05_0010_0016;NOT USED
ev05_0010_0017;Hey, maybe we could go instead.
ev05_0010_0018;Yeah! Mr. Warrior here, he and the brigade[~]should stick around and keep the goblins in line.
ev05_0010_0019;That’s right. Cornelia’s legendary Champion[~]belongs right here in Cornelia.
ev05_0010_0020;We’re the best fit for this.[~]We’ve got tons of Mirages to collect,[~]and could start just about anywhere.
ev05_0010_0021;So, you know, it wouldn’t be any trouble.
ev05_0010_0022;What a kind offer. You would really do that?
ev05_0010_0023;Sure! You’re doing us a favor[~]by pointing me and Lann in a new direction.
ev05_0010_0024;We’re glad to help.
ev05_0010_0025;I thank you. We are in your debt.
ev05_0010_0026;Here. All Cornelian emissaries are given these letters,[~]as proof of their authority.[~]It should help you on your way.
ev05_0010_0027;Thanks!
ev05_0010_0028;Well, there’s no sense in hanging around.[~]So long! Take care!
