sub37_010_0000;I must do my part and fight.[~]Whatever’s out there, I’m going to have to face it with courage.
sub37_010_0001;The Mirage in these latest reports sounds particularly nasty. Cloud![~]...Oh right, he’s not here.
sub37_010_0002;Squall![~]...No, he’s out on a mission too.
sub37_010_0003;I’ll take this one.
sub37_010_0004;Terra? Are you ready for it?
sub37_010_0005;Yes. If you need my help, I can fight.
sub37_010_0006;Okay then. But, be extra careful, please.[~]Something feels...off about this one.
sub37_010_0007;One witness said, “I can’t believe a freak of nature like that even exists.”[~]I’m quoting that word for word.
sub37_010_0008;A Mirage that’s too hideous to be true?[~]I see...
sub37_010_0009;You can handle this, Terra. Come on.
sub37_010_0010;Geh heh, gwee hee hee hee hee![~]Oh, this one’s a tasty morsel! I’d love to get my tentacles around her...
sub37_010_0011;Wh-who are you?
sub37_010_0012;Don’t tell me you haven’t heard of Ultros![~]This puss belongs to an octo-PUS extraordinaire!
sub37_010_0013;[f2]Hold on! Is this the Mirage from the reports?[/f][~]Hey—someone has been causing trouble around here. Is it you?
sub37_010_0014;Ohhh nooo, I would never!
sub37_010_0015;Buuut, I know the crook you’re after. Oh, what a fiend![~]How’s this: why don’t I help you out and show you the way to his lair?
sub37_010_0016;Huh? Really?
sub37_010_0017;Oh, I’d love to!
sub37_010_0018;Geh heh, geh hee hee hee hee![~]She’s more than tasty... She’s so deliciously naive I can’t resist!
sub37_010_0019;I think I might’ve just bagged me a winner here, folks!
sub37_010_0020;Hm? What did you say?
sub37_010_0021;Uhhh, nothing worth repeating!
sub37_010_0022;Hey um, about that hideous Mirage...[~]Would you say it’s nearby?
sub37_010_0023;Oh, it’ll still be a ways.
sub37_010_0024;Listen...could you tell me where you’re taking me?
sub37_010_0025;Geh heh, geh hee hee hee!
sub37_010_0026;Uh, why, somewhere that you and I[~]can have plenty of fun together, of course!
sub37_010_0027;What?! Then this whole time, you’ve been lying to me?!
sub37_010_0028;You really [f2]are[/f] a nasty Mirage.[~]But this is it. You’re through!
sub37_010_0029;Daaah! All right, ya got me, I might have told a fib.[~]But no, I’m not the nasty McNast you’re hunting for, I swear!
sub37_010_0030;It doesn’t matter. You deceive people[~]for who knows what awful purposes... Never again!
sub37_010_0031;Whyyy youuu... Fine! Be that waaay![~]Didn’t want to keep up the act anywaaay!
sub37_010_0032;You wanna know who’s been inking up a stink in this neighborhood?[~]Ultros has. Ooh, shocker! Geh hah hah hah hah!
sub37_010_0033;Huh? What’s wrong?[~]Tell me, does that make me a bad octopus? Sorry, so sorry!
