sub17_030_0000;Huh? Well [f2]that[/f] was easy...
sub17_030_0001;Quacho?!
sub17_030_0002;Keecho?!
sub17_030_0003;H-hey! Lann! Reynn![~]Get away from that thing!
sub17_030_0004;Eeyaaah!
sub17_030_0005;Wha-what?!
sub17_030_0006;What’s going on?
sub17_030_0007;The last queen warned me about this but[~]I refused to believe her!
sub17_030_0008;When it expires, that monster will trigger a huuuge explosion[~]with blast-tastrous consequences!
sub17_030_0009;Dude, what?[~][f2]Now[/f] you tell us?!
sub17_030_0010;When you say “huuuge,” do you mean...
sub17_030_0011;Y–yes. The last time that kraken kraka-boomed,[~]the destruction it wrought split the entire continent in two!
sub17_030_0012;Dude, it WHAAAAAAT?!
sub17_030_0013;But, we’ll the-never escape that kind of megaton in time!
sub17_030_0014;Be quiet!
sub17_030_0015;Huh?!
sub17_030_0016;Huh?!
sub17_030_0017;Huh?!
sub17_030_0018;Huh?!
sub17_030_0019;Are you ready? Then tremble and quake![~]See the spell I’ve taken time to make!
sub17_030_0020;Now hold on to your hats...
sub17_030_0021;And taaake [f2]THAAAT![/f]
sub17_030_0022;Aaaaaah!
sub17_030_0023;Aaaaaah!
sub17_030_0024;Quaaaaaa!
sub17_030_0025;Noooooo!
sub17_030_0026;Qua-cho!
sub17_030_0027;Chooo?!
sub17_030_0028;Huh?
sub17_030_0029;Huh?
sub17_030_0030;Cho?
sub17_030_0031;Hweh?
sub17_030_0032;Cho?
sub17_030_0033;It seems my new magic is a great success.[~]Dispelageddon—and its canceling effects! Ahhh ha ha ha ha!
sub17_030_0034;Uh... What just happened?
sub17_030_0035;I might have known you pups[~]would struggle so much to keep up.
sub17_030_0036;Once I learned that tentacled terror’s life was getting close to ending,[~]I devised a spell to contain the blast the creature’s death was portending.
sub17_030_0037;I knew, before it breathed its last, I’d have to unleash my new magic![~]My Dispelageddon—it pacified this nightmare pelagic.
sub17_030_0038;So your new magic—[~]it wasn’t meant for [f2]causing[/f] explosions?
sub17_030_0039;Oh, I tend to shun magic that has already been done.
sub17_030_0040;Uh... Fair enough.
sub17_030_0041;Moving is for total losers. But I’ll be able to stay in Besaid now,[~]thanks to you feebleminded assistant defusers.
sub17_030_0042;Ahhh ha ha ha ha!
sub17_030_0043;You know...[~]She wears me out.
sub17_030_0044;Me too.
sub17_030_0045;Uh, tell me...[~]Just what is the meaning of all this?
sub17_030_0046;Uh, I guess...everything worked out!
sub17_030_0047;Qua-cho?
sub17_030_0048;Yeah, you know—[~]that thing was set to blow whether we opened the door or not.
sub17_030_0049;It’s true. She wasn’t exactly nice about it, but,[~]it looks like Dr. Shantotto saved us all.
sub17_030_0050;And that’s great news for you.[~]The Sunken Temple will be safe for good now.
sub17_030_0051;Ooh! I never realized![~]Who knew that human-people were such benevolent organisms!
sub17_030_0052;Uh... I wouldn’t say [f2]totally[/f] benevolent.
sub17_030_0053;Up until we stepped in,[~]I’m pretty sure Dr. Shantotto was genuinely trying to kill her.
sub17_030_0054;Oh my. Reynn, Lann.[~]Quachokind owes you dearly.
sub17_030_0055;Uh, Lann...
sub17_030_0056;Uh, yeah?
sub17_030_0057;Chowaaa![~]Make this strange sensation go awaaay!
sub17_030_0058;Kee kee kee!
sub17_030_0059;Quacho!
