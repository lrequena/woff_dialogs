ev19_0055_0000;Lann, are we there the-yet? ’Cause I think my legs are about to the-fall off.
ev19_0055_0001;I hear you. I’m about ready to... Hey, wait, you’re not even walking!
ev19_0055_0002;......
ev19_0055_0003;Sis?
ev19_0055_0004;Hweh? Reynn, is something the-wrong?
ev19_0055_0005;No trivia... So I guess that means she isn’t upset at me.
ev19_0055_0006;Hellooo? Reynn?
ev19_0055_0007;Uh, what’s up?
ev19_0055_0008;That’s what I wanna know. What’s the deal?
ev19_0055_0009;Uh, it’s hard to explain. I guess I sort of get the feeling...I’ve been here before.
ev19_0055_0010;Well, it does look like Nine Wood Hills.
ev19_0055_0011;It might the-be déjà vu!
ev19_0055_0012;The Day of Javoo? Is that, like, doomsday? “Bow before the mighty Javoo, humans!”
ev19_0055_0013;We’ll just pretend he’s not the-here. Reynn, do you the-want to take a break? I don’t the-mind.
ev19_0055_0014;Oh, no, I’ll be fine. Thanks, Tama. Let’s keep moving!
ev19_0055_0015;Roger the-dodger!
ev19_0055_0016;But what about the mighty Javoo?!
