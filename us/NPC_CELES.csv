npc_celes_0000_0000;Keepers, I wish you luck.
npc_celes_0001_0000;Come by and visit whenever you like.
npc_celes_0001_0001;Can I help you find something?
npc_celes_0001_0002;You look well. Not much has changed around here.
npc_celes_0001_0003;Don’t let your past define you. Now is what counts.
npc_celes_0001_0004;Don’t worry. We’ve handled bleaker situations than this.
npc_celes_0001_0005;And...Cid’s had fewer episodes.
npc_celes_0002_0000;The town Cid and I called home was destroyed by the Federation. It, and the entire continent it was on, no longer exist.
npc_celes_0002_0001;The magic I possess is a result of experiments the Federation performed on me.
npc_celes_0002_0002;There were others besides me subjected to similar experimentation. Most of them were women.
npc_celes_0002_0003;It could be women were more suited to their experiments, or perhaps it was just some sort of sick preference on their part.
npc_celes_0002_0004;In retrospect, I imagine they must have been trying to artificially create Champions,
npc_celes_0002_0005;so that they could harvest our souls for some nefarious purpose.
