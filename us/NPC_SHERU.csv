npc_sheru_0000_0000;Make yourselves right at home.
npc_sheru_0000_0001;Normally, I would’ve charged you through the roof for that warlock’s warmer. Just so you know.
npc_sheru_0000_0002;Good of you to come.
npc_sheru_0000_0003;Would it kill you to loosen those purse strings a little bit when you visit?
npc_sheru_0000_0004;Hey, don’t expect me to help.
npc_sheru_0000_0005;Meow.
npc_sheru_0000_0006;Oh, so you’ve met the undead airhead? Feel free to put her out of her misery whenever you want.
npc_sheru_0000_0007;Oh hey. I didn’t expect to see you so soon. I can’t tell if you’re really busy, or really bored.
npc_sheru_0000_0008;Don’t worry about me. If those freaks show up here, I’ll have them crying uncle in no time.
