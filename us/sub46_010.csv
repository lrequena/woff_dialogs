sub46_010_0000;Hey, you know that really big Mirage we have? Why is it so huge?
sub46_010_0001;It’s more than the-huge—it’s mega! A “Mega Mirage”!
sub46_010_0002;Can we even use something that big in our stacks?
sub46_010_0003;Well, I wouldn’t the-recommend stacking it on top of you. Not unless you want to get squished the-flat.
sub46_010_0003_2;Ooh, ouch, we don’t want that. But [f2]we[/f] could stack on top of [f2]them[/f], right?
sub46_010_0004;You sure the-can! But you’ll need to use the-both your powers in battle if you want to summon forth a Mega Mirage.
sub46_010_0004_2;Maybe you’ve already the-given it a try, but still...
sub46_010_0005;don’t be the-afraid to add Mega Mirages to your lineup and test them out in battle.
sub46_010_0006;Sounds good! I’m the kind of guy that learns best in the heat of the moment.
sub46_010_0007;In other words, you hate studying and you won’t practice.
