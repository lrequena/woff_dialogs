sub17_020_0000;What’s this?[~]You children would dare my punishment to resist?
sub17_020_0001;Did you think I could be beaten by anyone so hopelessly frail?[~]Such madness is beyond the pale.
sub17_020_0002;Wait! Just hold on for a second, Dr. Shantotto!
sub17_020_0003;L-Lann and I are both really sorry.
sub17_020_0004;Huh? O-oh! Very sorry! Forgive us![~]We’ll do anything you want, so please!
sub17_020_0005;Aaanythiiing?
sub17_020_0006;Then fine. I can pardon you [f2]this[/f] time. Ahhh ha ha ha ha!
sub17_020_0007;So um, doctor...why were you trying to[~]do the Quacho Queen in again?
sub17_020_0008;Say I’m inclined to open the door at the heart of the shrine.
sub17_020_0009;But therein lies the hitch.[~]You see, only Miss Birdbrain can access that particular niche.
sub17_020_0010;But, if she happens to buy the farm,[~]the door’s defenses become, shall we say...easy to disarm.
sub17_020_0011;Yeah, uh... We’ll have a chat with her and convince her[~]to open the door voluntarily, so, maybe you can find it in your heart to,[~]I don’t know, maybe, [f2]not[/f] kill her?
sub17_020_0012;Oh! Very well, then. I thought for sure you’d prefer my approach.[~]But ask her, if it’s a subject you can broach.
sub17_020_0013;By the way,[~]why do you want to open that particular door so the-badly?
sub17_020_0014;By the way,[~]what’s so special about that door, if it’s okay to ask?
sub17_020_0015;Do not press your luck.[~]Now find the she-bird and get that door unstuck!
sub17_020_0016;Uh, right!
sub17_020_0017;Qua-cho?
sub17_020_0018;Quacho?
sub17_020_0019;Let her through the door? But— Egads! Certainly not![~]The last queen made it abundantly clear that I was never ever to open—
sub17_020_0020;Oh! So you’d rather sleep with the fishes [f2]permanently[/f].
sub17_020_0021;Whoooa![~]Dr. Shantotto, just, hang on!
sub17_020_0022;Your...Majesty?
sub17_020_0023;Uh... Yes?
sub17_020_0024;Will you do it for me? Please, open the door.[~]Whatever happens, I promise I’ll make it right.
sub17_020_0025;......!
sub17_020_0026;Chowaaa! I-if you really want me to,[~]I suppose I could open the door this once.
sub17_020_0027;Keecho?!
sub17_020_0028;Qua...quacho?
sub17_020_0029;You’ll do it? I love you!
sub17_020_0030;Wh-what did you say?[~]Chowaaa!
sub17_020_0031;Um, this is seriously starting to worry me on multiple levels.
sub17_020_0032;Quaaachooo!
sub17_020_0033;Chooo!
sub17_020_0034;Quaaa-chooo!
sub17_020_0035;Now. “Anything” was the word you used, I recall?
sub17_020_0036;Huh?
sub17_020_0037;Good! Go and have a ball!
sub17_020_0038;I demand you finish that thing at once!
sub17_020_0039;Why, dude?
