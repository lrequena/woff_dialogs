sub38_020_0000;Whew... I guess all that training paid off.
sub38_020_0001;How did you cause that miracle to happen?
sub38_020_0002;Don’t diminish all my hard work[~]by writing it off as a “miracle.” Honestly.
sub38_020_0003;You’re still just a heretic...
sub38_020_0004;I don’t care what it is you choose to believe in.
sub38_020_0005;But look. Don’t just go around fanning people’s fears.[~]Why not do something meaningful? Make the situation better.
sub38_020_0006;The thing about higher powers...[~]They don’t help people who don’t help themselves. No way.
sub38_020_0007;......
sub38_020_0008;I suppose...that’s fair.[~]So, um...I'm sorry.
sub38_020_0009;Oh no. There’s no need for you to apologize.
sub38_020_0020;With the world in such dire straits,[~]we need to band together. Right?
sub38_020_0011;Help from above [f2]will[/f] come...when we earn it.
