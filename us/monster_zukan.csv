CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER001_01;A fox-like Mirage that, for whatever reason, attacks with Foxfire.[~]The celebrated artist Guildenbrandt once foolishly attempted to use a yurugu as a paintbrush...[~]but needless to say, he found the experience to be completely unpaletteable.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER001_02;A nine-tailed terror also known as the “black fox.”[~]Technically, it has one tail and eight butt-swords, but let’s not nitpick.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER001_03;Lann and Reynn’s trusty navigator.[~]She’s not a bunny rabbit, in case there’s any confusion there.[~]Claims to smell like rainbows. As it turns out, there’s no way to prove her wrong.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER001_04;Tama’s tongue twister of a transfiguration. Pronounced “tah-mah-MOE-hee-may.”[~]She’s looking divine, to be sure, but...how to put this... The chest hair does come as a surprise?
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER002_01;A tyke with a flair for flames. His horns get frequent compliments.[~]Wears a warm scarf, despite basically being on fire.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER002_02;A fritt in the throes of adolescence.[~]You can tell from the attitude and the fact that he desperately, [f2]desperately [/f]needs a haircut.[~]Let’s just hope someone raises him right and teaches him the difference between affright and affwrong.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER002_03;A Mirage whose powerful flames eradicate all foes.[~]Famous among even the laziest of the FF faithful, since he usually shows up early in the story.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER002_05;An exceptionally rare female ifrit who’s gunning for a spot in the regular FF lineup.[~]She’s tough enough to do it, too. No wonder Ifrit doesn’t like her.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER002_11;"A small Mirage resembling a fritt. This rare variant keeps a low profile.[~]Attempts to befriend it by singing pop songs will not work
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER002_12;A grown-up weeglee. Years of bracelet-lifting have made him bigger, stronger, snarlier.[~]Oh, and don’t worry, he’s wearing pants: nature’s pants.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER002_13;A grand gleed. It looks like an ifrit, but nope—different beast altogether.[~]The bracelets are part of his body and contain agelong reserves of magic. 
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER003_01;An adorable ice pixie with a knack for ice magic and a fondness for colder climes.[~]Has no button nose, and those eyes of hers definitely aren’t made out of coal.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER003_02;A bablizz that’s grown into a chilly little ice princess.[~]Her magic arsenal has expanded to more than just ice attacks, but her vocabulary still needs some work.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER003_03;A Mirage known for putting her adversaries on ice.[~]Ask her to make you a slushy! She’s surprisingly cool about that kind of stuff.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER003_05;A rare male shiva. Drives his female counterpart up the wall with lengthy “superhero” monologues.[~]Cannot be defeated with space rocks or the color yellow.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER003_11;Some Mirages, like this one, possess unique traits that set them apart from others in their tribe.[~]But despite the “brr” in her name, she’s not actually colder than a bablizz.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER003_12;A brrblizz that has evolved into what looks like a little girl.[~]Despite years of training, she still hasn’t figured out how to use her cape as a second pair of legs.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER003_13;"A fully grown Mirage as powerful as Shiva herself.[~]Some folks might glance at the “dark queen” getup and assume she needs a hug or something
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER004_01;"A wired tyke who’s still learning to absorb lightning. His magic set remains limited.[~]Don’t confuse him with a certain-colored mage
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER004_02;A Mirage that resembles a little boy.[~]He’s gotten the hang of summoning lightning with a snap of his fingers, and looks good doing it.[~]But you might not want to shake his hand.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER004_03;A Mirage whose Judgment Bolt reduces everything to ash.[~]His mortal enemy, therefore, must be a pile of ash, because...well, what can he do to it?
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER004_05;Ramuh’s granddaughter and a truly, er, eloquent speaker.[~]Her hair spikes up when electrified, saving her hours of primping in front of the bathroom mirror every morning.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER004_11;A mage-like Mirage with red eyes. Still not particularly adept at the whole “zapping” thing.[~]Maybe he’s snapping his fingers wrong...if he has fingers. (Does he even have arms?)
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER004_12;"An evolved joult that can wield darkness as well as electricity
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER004_13;A being with powers akin to a ramuh’s. When he wants to shock you, he really shocks you.[~]President of the Burned My Hair Off Club For Men.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER005_01;A Mirage that travels in numbers. Has a nasty set of gnashers, but rarely attacks by biting.[~]After all, goblin-punching is way, way more satisfying.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER005_02;A more powerful goblin equipped with sword and shield. The leader of the pack, so to speak.[~]Not to be confused with the goblin gourd, which doesn’t actually exist.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER005_03;"The princess of the goblins. Also princess of getting the wrong idea.[~]Her helmet’s horns move when she gets worked up
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER005_04;You can’t accuse these scamps of hitting below the belt, because they go for your eyes instead.[~]Untrue fact: they turn their helmets red by sheer willpower!
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER005_11;"A goblin commander capable of buffing all allies. That’s why their armor is so shiny.[~]Ha ha ha! Just kidding
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER005_12;A giant goblin, but not a Jiant goblin. Carries a big sword that (thankfully!) rarely hits the mark.[~]Its hobbies include eating, sleeping, eating, eating, sleeping, and...well, you get the idea.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER006_01;"A little chocobo that loves to waddle around. These feathery friends love to head-butt things
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER006_02;One of many birds valued throughout Grymoire as a mode of transport. Flightless, but fleet on their feet.[~]The males are called “chocobros”...by no one, if there’s any justice in the world.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER006_05;Cogna. A chocobo made entirely of what appears to be machinery.[~]This was the producer’s idea and the artist approved, which means it’s canon right down to the cannons.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER006_11;A chocochick born with black feathers. Even their bones are black, just like a certain rare breed of chicken.[~]For whatever reason, just their eyes are red. Allergies, perhaps?
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER006_12;A black chocobo with a vicious personality. He can run faster than most other chocobos.[~]Apparently this particular specimen gained fame in a place called the Gold Saucer.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER007_01;A wolflike Mirage with sharp fangs and thick fur to protect against the cold.[~]You could say that it has a “nakk” for hunting...but please don’t say that.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER007_03;A Mirage that inhabits colder regions and uses swift attacks and its Ice Storm ability to corner prey.[~](Wheels and sword compartment not included with this model.)
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER007_04;A huge Mirage that attacks with three elements from its three heads—two of which, strangely,[~]don’t seem to be attached. A certain Mr. Valentine packs a gun named after this Mirage, but neither he[~]nor his weapon seem to be around.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER007_11;"A nakk with high resistance to fire. Even its teeth are like hot coals
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER007_13;Another type of fenrir. He seems to have some sort of history with Eiko’s tribe.[~]It’s a common mistake to mix his name up with that of El Fenrir, the famous invisible Cornelian luchador. 
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER008_01;Don’t rock-a-bye this baby, or you’ll be sorry when it counters. Those horns are plenty sharp![~]You probably have some theories about what this will turn into when it grows up.[~]Those theories are quite correct.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER008_03;A hulking beast with large, powerful horns. Also a heavy mouth breather.[~]But even heavier than that is its fearsome Heavy Counter, which is enough to make even the spooniest bard[~]sorry he swung his lute.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER008_04;This legendary brute comes complete with twice the ferocity and thrice the anger management issues of its[~][f2]relatively [/f]calmer kin. Walks on two legs to show off its ripped abs.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER008_11;A beast wreathed in lightning. It specializes in thunder attacks and packs a mean magical counter.[~]The more one stares at it, though, the more one has to wonder: what exactly is it chewing?
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER008_13;A formidable foe with large horns that positively crackle with electricity.[~]Thanks to this, it’s never had a good hair day. Watch out for its powerful strikes and magical counterattack.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER009_01;A penguin-like Mirage. Specializes in water magic and counterattacks.[~]Oh, and if you’ve been wondering, it’s named after its cry, and not crying its name.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER009_02;An inhabitant of colder areas that can target an area and put enemies inside it to sleep.[~]And once they are...the true quaching begins. Has a secret quacho cry not audible to human ears.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER009_11;A ruler who aspires to greatness, but falls apart in the presence of human males. There is no quacho king.[~]She’s a bit arrogant, and rarely addresses people in the second person, but try not to hold it against her.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER010_01;Everybody’s favorite fuzzball with the funny way of talking, kupo. Attacks and heals using equally funny dances.[~]Apparently, they’re willing to take just about any job if it means they get a role in the story.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER010_02;Marine moogles with a penchant for piracy. They spend their weekends relaxing on the beach.[~]Through the wonders of Grymoirian magic (also known as “budget limitations”), they all share the same voice.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER010_11;A sparkling star of the moogle world whose pom-pom halo glows like the sun.[~]Also functions as a night-light in a pinch...and looks like a planet if you cover the bottom half with your hand!
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER010_12;An expert at water attacks. These moogles roll with a different crowd than Faris’s crew, but that story...[~]will have to wait for another day. Watch out for their “Kuparrr!” ability, which causes berserk.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER011_01;An aquatic Mirage with a short temper that regularly attacks swimmers.[~]Plans to one day star in its own movie, [f2]Chomper 2: The Sharqual. [/f]There is no part one.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER011_02;A souped-up sharqual that excels at critical attacks.[~]Its massive fangs and frame are the stuff of nightmares. Watch out for its...megabites?
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER011_03;A colossal—and yet colossally hard to find—white Mirage.[~]“But Bismarck is supposed to be a [f2]whale!”[/f] you may be thinking, as you run to the nearest wiki.[~]Well, friend, we made some adjustments.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER011_11;A sharqual in jungle camo. Watch out for those sneak attacks...[~]Wait, hold on a second! How does jungle camouflage even work [f2]outside the jungle?![/f][~]Talk about a fish out of water.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER011_12;A nightsqual grown to mega proportions. One might wonder why he’d even bother with camouflage[~]when he’s that big, but hey—fashion doesn’t have to make sense.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER012_01;Baby or not, this tonberry has it out for you. Watch out for that Petty Grudge.[~]Listen kid, we don’t know where you got that, but put it down. Knives aren’t toys.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER012_02;A Mirage that wields a lantern in one hand and a knife in the other.[~]Seriously dangerous if you let them shuffle too close, so consider this your official warning.[~]Fun fact: the lantern is only there so [f2]you[/f] can see [f2]them[/f].
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER012_03;A tonberry king’s knife is brutal, and with his Everyone’s Grudge ability he can exact revenge for fallen friends.[~]Despite that toasty-warm outfit, he hates the heat. Still, he knows how to green and bear it.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER012_11;A wielder of light and ice magic. These guys have the same Petty Grudge as their cousins.[~]They’re not berries covered in yogurt...although it’s admittedly hard to unsee once that’s in your head.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER012_12;A white blight that wields fearsome light magic and an even fearsomer knife.[~]Rumor has it that under the robe is a T-shirt that reads: “I’m Not Pale, I’m Pigmentally Challenged.”
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER012_13;"A king among paleberries, he brings to battle formidable light magic and special abilities.[~]Note: That crown isn’t silver
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER013_01;An undead Mirage that can unleash an entire spellbook’s worth of magical attacks.[~]Don’t mistake it for a trick-or-treater.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER013_04;Everyone’s favorite undead princess. Seems to maybe sort of have a history with Sherlotta?[~]Hmm... If she’s a princess, shouldn’t she have a kingdom? But let’s not go there... It’s a dead end.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER013_11;"A Mirage that excels in earth magic, but don’t forget that scythe leaves a nasty mark too.[~]Try not to run into this scamp in a dark alley. Also, that’s not a mask
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER016_01;Composed almost entirely of copper, this metal with the mettle takes pride in his tough hide.[~]It is incredibly satisfying to face one of these and shout, “Myeeah, see! You’ll never take me alive, copper!”[~](If you got that reference, then congratulations! You are old!)
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER016_03;A towering Mirage made of a rare metal. Capable of taking a beating, and strong as well.[~]Mythril is harder than steel, so fist-bumping is not recommended.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER016_04;With its mighty blade and mightier Mighty Guard skill, this Mirage is one dangerous customer.[~]You might think the mythril giant should be stronger, since mythril is both rarer and harder.[~]Well, not this time.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER016_11;A metallic Mirage with a toxic touch and a Body Slam ability that takes full advantage of its hardened body.[~]You may think this gnome is a leader. Sadly, you’ve been “lead” astray. (Hurr hurr.)
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER016_13;A Mirage with a menacing mace that delivers punishing blows. Takes less damage when unstacked.[~]The burning question is, is it chrome-plated, or chrome all the way through?
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER017_01;A cute little forest animal... Or at least that’s what it wants you to think. Then, POW! A tail-punch to the jaw![~]This Mirage has nothing to do with the legendary continent. May or may not squeak, “Mu!” when upset.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER017_02;A mu relative that’s constantly munching on a skull. Cute, but don’t let that fool you or you’ll be next.[~]Technically, it just nibbles skulls and doesn’t actually eat them—but sadly, “nibbler”  was already taken.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER017_03;That floating ruby is actually part of the carbuncle’s body, and is used to unleash a variety of attacks.[~]This cutie dreams of being a truckbuncle or trainbuncle one day...but never something so dreadfully ordinary[~]as a planebuncle. (Get it? Plane/Plain? It’s funny.)
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER017_11;A mu originally found in a place called the River Belle. So why is it called a “reaver mu”?[~]Well, kids, that’s because it was mistranslated in that [f2]other [/f]game. However, the idea of a cute, fluffy river Mirage[~]plundering Grymoire was so charming that we decided “what the hey!” And that’s how mistakes live forever.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER017_12;A relative of the mu that continually munches on skull-shaped nuts. Can heal itself with a nutty bite.[~]...Wait, what’s this? It’s the one that carved the nut into a skull?! Dude!
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER017_13;A carbuncle that uses a topaz’s power for its various abilities.[~]By the way, did you know that imperial topaz is the rarest among topaz’s naturally occurring colors?[~]Well, now you do, and knowledge is also power.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER018_01;An ophidian Mirage found along Grymoire’s shores. Attacks with both water and its flippers.[~]Sea snakes aren’t exactly made for terra firma, but they manage to be mobile on land through sheer force of will.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER018_03;A sea dragon that excels at water attacks and commands a powerful Tsunami ability.[~]It even knows how to swim on land. Try doing [f2]that [/f]in your backyard.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER018_04;Syldra’s Mirage kin. Watch out when they attack all their foes at once with Thunderstorm.[~]Apparently these monstrosities pick up various pet names depending on where they’re sighted,[~]but none of those monikers should be considered “loched” in as official.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER018_05;Even mountains bow before this Mirage’s mighty Tidal Wave.[~]Bahamut frequently steals her spotlight these days. Maybe she just needs to get out of the water more?
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER018_11;Faris’s best friend, and her ship’s primary means of motion. Wait...does that make her ship a sea chariot?[~]Oh, and don’t worry. There won’t be any tearful beach good-byes on this adventure.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER019_01;A Mirage that uses its hard shell to protect companions from attack.[~]But flip these sheldons over and they will shed soft turtle tears.[~]They’re quite young, so maybe mini-[f2]boy[/f]-toise would be more appropriate. (...Or maybe not.)
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER019_03;A minimantoise variant that uses fire attacks. Its Bask ability allows it to heal during combat.[~]It claims it can breathe fire underwater...but chances are it’s just selling smoke.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER019_04;Any minimantoise that lives long enough can grow this big.[~]As you might expect, weak attacks will simply bounce off an adamantoise’s incredibly hard shell.[~]It’s said they dream of learning how to fly, but pigs have a better chance.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER019_11;NOT USED IN MIRAGE MANUAL?
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER020_01;A bovine bully who specializes in topple attacks. That club he’s swinging is a force to be reckoned with.[~]Wandered out of a labyrinth one day and never looked back.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER020_02;A Mirage that uses a giga-sized hammer to clobber his foes.[~]When he charges with Bulldozer, get out of the way, because punching [f2]this [/f]bull in the gut on the third hop[~]isn’t going to send him to the mat. (Maybe he’s just not bald enough.)
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER020_11;This “little” lady likes to arm-wrestle her brothers, and you’d better believe she holds her own.[~]Has a habit of charging her own reflection. Maybe it’s self-loathing, or maybe she just sees red.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER020_12;Is it a tank? A robot? Nope, it’s just a whole lot of bull.[~]...Hmm? Why does a sistertaur transfig into a “bull”? Hey, don’t have a cow just because [f2]we [/f]don’t have a cow.[~]And try not to get skewered on those massive horns when it charges, okay?
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER021_01;“Ribbit ribbit,” this crooner sings from the swamp—then blam! You Got Status Ailment![~]Wait a minute, a water toad... Doesn’t that just make it a frog?
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER021_02;A toad that favors windy places. But you’ve already figured that much out, haven’t you?[~]These croak-and-dagger types like to lullaby prey to sleep before they strike.[~]Every Sunday, they get together for a cappella practice, followed by burgers and french flies.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER021_11;Anyone lucky enough to chance upon this toad will be blessed with good fortune.[~]Unless, of course, you hate amphibians, in which case there’s nothing fortunate about it at all.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER023_01;"A Mirage that flaps around on a set of tiny little wings.[~]Attempts to suck blood when it runs low on health—but hey, haven’t we all been there?[~]Swing this bat all you want
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER023_02;"A Mirage with sharp fangs that don’t just suck blood
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER023_04;The bitee’s biter’s biter. In other words, the nosferatu who first nibbled on a non-feratu.[~]Legend has it that he’s immortal, invincible, invulnerable, incorrigible, indigestible... A whole lot of “ins.”[~]He’s not the First Vampire Ever—we know that distinction is taken—but he’s still bad news.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER023_11;A Mirage that lives in cold climates. Wields ice magic in addition to its vampiric powers.[~]Did you notice the bat-shaped patch there on its face? It’s a bat within a bat! [f2]Batception![/f][~]Don’t attempt a home run with [f2]this [/f]bat, or you might just shatter it.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER023_12;An icy vampire lord. Has the ability to absorb life from those foolish enough to attack it.[~]So wait... “Demi” means “half,” right? Which half is vampire? Shh, it’s a secret.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER024_01;Rumor has it that something nice will happen if you give this potted pal an elixir. Keep your ears open![~]Also, are those tongues or paws sticking out of there? How deeply unsettling.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER024_02;A Mirage disguised as a treasure chest to surprise unwary treasure hunters.[~]There’s no escaping one in battle. The poor thing has developed serious identity issues, but hey, that’s the job. [~]Also, let’s make it official: this mimic has no relation to that [f2]other [/f] famous mimic in our game lineup.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER024_03;This opulent mimic miss is covered with expensive-looking gems.[~]If there’s a mimic queen, where’s the mimic king? Hey, that’s what [f2]she [/f]wants to know!
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER024_11;This crazy crockery excels at support, but its attacks leave something to be desired.[~]Untrue fact: the creators agonized for years over what to call the magic pot’s successor: the magic casserole dish,[~]the magic dutch oven... Ultimately, “jar” turned out to be the least...er, jarring.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER024_12;This mimic relative gleams and glitters in the light. Its pigtails are actually extendable drills.[~]Considering its faux chest-bits are made of solid gold, you could probably cash it in for more than whatever else[~]you thought was inside... [f2]But mimics have feelings. They aren’t yours to sell! [/f]—Mimic Civil Liberties Union
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER025_02;A Mirage found in desserts. Attacks with chocolate syrup and— Hold on. Sorry.[~]Correction: this is a [f2]desert [/f]Mirage that uses [f2]earth [/f]attacks that leverage its massive frame.[~]Of course, technically, that means it does still specialize in “rocky road.”
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER025_12;A marine menace that lurks near Grymoire’s shores.[~]Some say that it looks as graceful as an angel when it swims...but we prefer to describe it as a nightmarish[~]sock puppet with teeth. Also, cancel this thing’s gym membership [f2]right now[/f].
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER027_01;A Mirage that loves slicing and dicing. Dangerous when paired with the left claw.[~]Insists that it’s left-handed, but it’s right. Wait...
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER027_11;A Mirage that loves dicing and slicing. Dangerous when paired with the right claw.[~]Would insist that it’s right-handed if it were here, but it’s already left.

CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER031_04;A classic FF baddie prone to using Self-Destruct—and neither friend nor foe is safe when it does. Watch out![~]Perhaps many of you have painful memories of this Mirage for one reason or another.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER031_12;Big and strong enough to earn the moniker “king.” All his friends say he’s a blast.[~]Uses Explode when defeated—which happens to be really bad news, so make sure you’re prepared.[~]Rumor has it this guy has a distant cousin called a “mom bomb.” Sadly, she’s sitting this story out in all but name.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER032_02;A wobbly little pudding creature with a high capacity for physical pain.[~]Cover its face with a napkin, toss a little caramel on it, and you have yourself an appetizing treat.[~]The actual flavor, however...
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER032_04;Highly resistant to physical damage, so magic is your best bet.[~]What flavor is a turquoise flan, anyway? This thing looks like it’s packed with artificial pigments and preservatives.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER032_05;A princess of the flan clan. Actually much meaner than she looks.[~]She’s been secretly planning a war against all other desserts. For a flan, that takes backbone.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER032_12;Her royal flanliness. She loves to dance, but her moves are more jiggle than wiggle.[~]All the same, they can put you in hot water if you let yourself be captivated.[~]By the way, how do you like her new makeover?
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER032_15;A massive, gelatinous tower of flan. If left to its own gurgling devices, it will grow and grow and grow.[~]The name may make it sound tasty, but remember: in Grymoire, flan eats you.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER033_01;Mandragoras live all over the world. These little guys may look cute, but don’t touch. They’re poisonous![~]While no one’s ever sighted one in the process of growing, you can never be too safe.[~]So if you see two floppy leaves sticking up, be smart and don’t yank them!
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER033_03;Covered with flailing tentacles, this malignant monstrosity really needs some mouthwash.[~]The fumes it exudes from its mouth cause all sorts of maladies... Just how bad is its Bad Breath?!
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER033_11;A dark-hued Mirage that uses plantlike attacks. Korrigans are absolutely inkorrigible to the...uh, kore.[~]They’re the real reason you shouldn’t garden after the sun goes down.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER033_13;The absolute worst smell you will ever face. Its Putrid Breath causes complete systematic meltdowns.[~]If you worked hard at it, you might be able to smell this bad too. But please, [f2]please [/f]don’t try.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER034_01;It may look like a cat, but what feline has a poisonous scorpion tail? This one.[~]Now, manticores are usually more lionlike, but this is Grymoire. And here, cats get around.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER034_03;Also known as the guardian of the desert, this Mirage skillfully wields both earth and enhancement magic.[~]Lately, the sphinxes have gotten bored of just riddles, so they’ve been doing a lot of sudoku.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER034_11;This is one gritty kitty—it almost looks like it’s made of sand.[~]Sandicores can sometimes neutralize physical attacks, so run through your options before you swing.[~]Doesn’t require a sandbox, litter box, or any other kind of box.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER034_13;A Mirage that has slowly turned to sand over time. Not a meme, but possibly meme-worthy.[~]After a memecoleous uses its Doom ability and starts the countdown, your turns are numbered.[~]So remember: never, ever invite one of these to a New Year’s Eve party.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER035_02;A most legendary beast with a single corn—er, horn adorning its forehead. Also known as the “spear horse.” [~]Insane, but—if you can get close enough, the horn doubles as a coat rack in an emergency.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER035_04;A demonic horse that puts you to sleep, then gallops through the dark corners of your dreams,[~]hooves aflame and eyes wild. If you manage to tame one and saddle up, does that make you a knight-mare?

CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER036_11;Whooosh! ...Goes a flaming streak across the sky. It’s a bird! It’s a dragon! Nope, it’s a nirvalefor![~]Fast as these Mirages are, they still can’t outrun the burning sensation that they’re late.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER036_12;A legendary firebird with miraculous regenerative powers.[~]As you may have noticed, these Mirages’ down feathers and pinions are used to create precious items.[~]“Nothing like a little phoenix down to help you phoenix up!” said no one ever... But they should!

CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER039_11;Resistant to fire. Both of its maws are practically dripping with venom.[~]Tends to get into heated arguments with itself that quickly escalate into fiery exchanges.[~]Despite being a bihydra, it doesn’t do so well with hydration.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER039_12;A dragon-like Mirage with three heads, each of which spits a different type of flame.[~]Its name is [f2]not, [/f]in fact, short for Greg the Huge Industrially Designed Roasting Apparatus, but you can call it Greg[~]if you want.

CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER039_13;A status-ailment-inducing disaster on four legs. Gets considerably more dangerous as its HP dwindles.[~]The heads on the back have worse breath than the heads on the front, but you [f2]don’t [/f]want to know why.[~]Also: not a pig, although it must eat a lot of pigs to grow this large.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER040_01;Cogna. Has six legs and is tough as nails. Its defenses definitely live up to the name.[~]Don’t confuse those claws for watermelons, or else even the world’s best dentist won’t be able to save you.

CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER040_11;Hunts down and exterminates all who oppose the Cogna’s will.[~]“Entom” means “bug.” As we pushed [f2]WORLD OF FINAL FANTASY [/f]through QA, we were hoping the testers[~]would report this guy and save players hours of misery, but apparently they just don’t love you that much.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER040_13;An omega variant that was created to annihilate all organic life.[~]It’s a shame there’s no such thing as an omega [f2]ban, [/f]because you’re going to want one after you face this thing.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER041_01;A tiny wind pixie that makes its home in forests and other places of natural beauty.[~]The sylphs are good friends of Serafie—in fact, she sometimes meets up with them to play cards and gossip—[~]so be sure to treat them with the same boundless affection Serafie expects you to feel for her.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER041_03;A Mirage who wields wind and provides support to allies. All that hear this siren’s song are driven wild.[~]She is usually seen flashing red and blue while chasing criminals— Wait, wrong siren.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER041_11;A laid-back wind pixie who has been buddy-buddy with Enna Kros for who knows how long.[~]She has a very...unique interpretation of the phrase “trying hard.” One of her greatest pleasures in life[~]is playing tricks on poor Tama.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER041_13;After years, if not eons of eyeing all those [f2]other [/f]transfiggers with considerable envy, Serafie has finally[~]managed to move up in the world. She insisted on the “diva” styling, but maybe that wasn’t such a good idea,[~]because now Tama has taken to calling her “Dweeba Serafie” instead.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER042_01;That face just screams, “I’m up to no good.”[~]Some of you might have lingering traumatic memories of a little ability called Confuse XVI.[~]Ah, the good ol’ days. Back then, the imps were [f2]really [/f]impudent.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER042_03;This Mirage is just a little monster. The absolute worst guy on the block. ...No, really.[~]He’s the sort that uses a magnifying glass to torture bugs. Or status ailments to pick on Mirage Keepers.[~]And yeah, we don’t know how to pronounce his name either.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER042_11;Through the power of fantasy, this Mirage can take your mind on truly frightful flights.[~]His greatest shame: the name on his left wing is spelled wrong.

CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER044_01;A wizard with a squid head. No, wait...is it a squid with a wizard’s body? Anyway.[~]A consummate connoisseur, the mindflayer only pairs the finest beverages with the brains it devours.[~]...Okay, honestly, that’s a pretty terrifying image.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER044_03;A massive monster from the deep that emits a poisonous mist to harry its foes.[~]Featured as one of the Four Fiends in the original [f2]FINAL FANTASY[/f]. If you spot all four of them together,[~]you can bet your barnacles some kind of chaos is afoot...
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER044_04;A tentacled terror that absolutely loves the ladies. (The feeling is not mutual.)[~]Seriously strong, seriously [f2]annoying[/f]. For better or for worse, and for all the wrong reasons, he’s a legend.[~]The passing years only make him more colorful.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER044_11;Part squid, part mage, and all style. Evil though it may look, it actually knows a bit of light magic.[~]Not related to any ancient gods. Ugh, why do people keep [f2]saying that?![/f]
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER044_13;A many-legged octopus-squid-thingy with a firm grasp of water magic.[~]Yes, we know water isn’t firm enough to be grasped. Nonetheless, this Mirage manages to pull it off.[~]Because a cenchos...[f2]never [/f]says “can’tchos.”
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER045_02;A dragon with a storm cloud for legs. Naturally, it uses thunder abilities.[~]Wait... If you stack with it, does that mean you get to ride a dragon? Nope—it rides you!
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER045_03;A type of dragon found all throughout the Dragon Scars.

CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER046_02;A dragon with a body that’s half mist. So cute! Just look at that face! Who couldn’t love that face?[~]Rydia’s familiar here on Grymoire is a mist dragon, and a gentle soul at that.

CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER046_12;A ginormous fire dragon. Everyone [f2]else [/f]has to go through this thing’s growing pains.[~]Unleashes a powerful fire ability as it loses HP. One of these babies could probably keep an entire city warm[~]throughout the winter.

CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER051_05;A titanic, humanoid Cogna. Originally manifested in a world outside of Grymoire.[~]True to its name, it’s likely to be the last thing you ever see. Its abdomen looks like it wants to eat you.

CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER052_01;A three-wheeled Cogna with a bad case of road rage.[~]A perfectionist when it comes to parallel parking. Somehow, it got its driver’s license on the first try.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER052_11;A three-wheeled Cogna with a bad case of road rage.[~]All the magna roaders’ paint jobs are based on the original models. Give [f2]FINAL FANTASY VI [/f]a spin if you’re curious!
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER052_21;A three-wheeled Cogna with a bad case of road rage.[~]Although there are three of these that share the same exact name, don’t worry.[~]Each of them always knows when to raise its wheels during roll call.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER053_01;A Mirage with a truly astounding ability to evade attacks.[~]Its jerky movements may lead you to think that our animators are lazy, or that your frame rate has taken a[~]sudden dive, but we can assure you that there is nothing wrong with us [f2]or [/f]your hardware, thank you.

CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER053_11;A cactuar relative that’s quick to make a run for it. Chances are it’ll zip away before you imprism it.[~]Oh, and never fear. It’s not rotting, it’s trotting (at high speed).
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER053_12;A stylish cactrot with an even more stylish ’stache. Its needles are razor sharp.[~]Everyone knows the plural of cactus is cacti, but what’s the plural of gigantrot? Gigantrotti?[~]It sounds a little like a secret organization, doesn’t it?

CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER056_12;This thing’s power levels are off the charts. Exists only to destroy everyone and everything. Trying to cook up a[~]name that sounds more powerful than “ultima” was actually kind of hard. We’re still not entirely pleased with[~]the results, but hopefully you’ll be too busy getting your keister handed to you to notice or care.
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER061_01;While these guys look like your regular flesh-and-blood black mages, they’re a little different.[~]These are artificial soldiers created by... Well, that’s a story in itself, and not one we’re about to spoil here.[~]How do they prove that they exist? Maybe they don’t exist...
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER070_01;"A soldier in the Bahamutian Army. They, too, can control Mirages, and use those Mirages to attack[~]the Federation’s enemies. Many Grymoirian Lilikin have been led to believe that the Federation will transform[~]them into Jiants so they can fit in that armor
CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER070_02;An officer in the Bahamutian Army. Naturally, officers are more powerful than your average soldier.[~]It is not possible for a Lilikin to become a Jiant. So then what, exactly, is this?

CHARA_DESCRIPTION_MONSTER016_21;A mini golem imbued with wind magic and the power to make any time nap time.[~]...Sorry, what was that? Why call it a “golem head” when it has a body? Hey, don’t sweat the small stuff, okay?
