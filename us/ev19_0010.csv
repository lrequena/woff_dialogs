ev19_0010_0000_2;[s40]The Other Nine Wood Hills[/s]
ev19_0010_0001;What [f2]is[/f] this?
ev19_0010_0002;The path that will take you to the Crystal Tower.
ev19_0010_0003;......?!
ev19_0010_0004;Who are—?!
ev19_0010_0005;Follow that path,[~]and you will find the answers you seek.
ev19_0010_0006;Answers?
ev19_0010_0007;Lusse Farna.
ev19_0010_0008;Huh?
ev19_0010_0009;If you wish to find her,[~]you must brave the Crystal Tower.
ev19_0010_0010;Then our mom’s up there somewhere?[~]She’s still alive?
ev19_0010_0011;The four keys you collected give you the right to know.[~]If you have the courage.
ev19_0010_0012;She the-vanished![~]Who in the-Grymoire was that?
ev19_0010_0013;Reynn. I’m going.
ev19_0010_0014;Wait.
ev19_0010_0015;Huh? What for?
ev19_0010_0016;Why did that woman tell us all that?[~]She must have had a reason.
ev19_0010_0017;Uh, well...[~]How in the honk am I supposed to know?
ev19_0010_0018;Does that mean you’re gonna quit?[~]After everything?
ev19_0010_0019;No, I just...
ev19_0010_0020;Come on, think about it.[~]There’s something funny about Grymoire.
ev19_0010_0021;Well, yeah, I’ll admit it’s kinda weird.[~]I mean, it’s full of little people and—
ev19_0010_0022;No, I’m not talking about that. The prophecies.[~]They treat us like characters in some kind of story.
ev19_0010_0023;It feels like someone wrote out a plan,[~]and you and I are just going along with it.
ev19_0010_0024;What? Whoa whoa whoa whoa.[~]Reynn, you are [f2]really[/f] overthinking this.
ev19_0010_0025;You’re underthinking it.
ev19_0010_0026;I... Okay, maybe you are right about that.
ev19_0010_0027;But don’t act like this “story” is writing itself![~]We almost died a bunch of times.
ev19_0010_0028;If we hadn’t collected so many Mirages,[~]we never could’ve made it this far.
ev19_0010_0029;The way I see it, we did that all on our own.[~]It wasn’t...pre, uh... Tama?
ev19_0010_0030;I think maybe the word you the-want is “preordained”?
ev19_0010_0031;That’s the one.[~]There’s no way it could have been preordinated.
ev19_0010_0032;Uh-huh. Or predestified, right?
ev19_0010_0033;All of this is starting to make my vocabulary the-hurt...
ev19_0010_0034;Well, one thing’s for sure.[~]We have no choice.
ev19_0010_0035;[f2]Eiko did say[~]that there was no changing the prophecy.[/f]
ev19_0010_0036;Reynn?
ev19_0010_0037;’Kay, let’s head for the Crystal Tower.
ev19_0010_0038;Oh. Okay!
