sub30_045_0000;Whoa! You are the worst kind of sleazy creep.[~]How dare you peep at people’s thoughts without asking them?!
sub30_045_0001;And you think it’s okay to twist her weaknesses around[~]when the poor girl doesn’t even know what’s real? You [f2]scum[/f].
sub30_045_0002;I’m [f2]scum?![/f][~]Wait, hold on. Didn’t we settle this last time?
sub30_045_0003;[f2]Last[/f] time? Yes, we [f2]did[/f] just fight![~]Why am I only remembering these things now?!

sub30_045_0009;Huh?
sub30_045_0010;The power of fantasy? Rubbish. That is [f2]my[/f] tribe’s domai—[~][f2]Now[/f] I see. The Guardians of Time have been busy.
sub30_045_0011;Fine. If that’s how you want to play, then so be it.[~]Come on!
sub30_045_0012;Whoa! A new form?! Awesome!
sub30_045_0013;Don’t come crying to me after you’re dead!
