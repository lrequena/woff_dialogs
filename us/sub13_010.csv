sub13_010_0000;If that hits us head on...
sub13_010_0001;Ha!
sub13_010_0002;I’ll just have to hold them off here.
sub13_010_0003;Good luck, Lightning, Eiko.[~]And my princess, Sarah.
sub13_010_0004;Well, that was cutting it close.[~]Lucky for us, it isn’t the sharpest tool in the shed, huh?
sub13_010_0005;Thank you for coming, Eiko.[~]Your journey here must have been long and risky.
sub13_010_0006;Huh? Awww! It really wasn’t that big of a deal.[~]I’m just happy I could be of service.
sub13_010_0007;And besides,[~]the only job I have is to “flip the switch,” so to speak.
sub13_010_0008;It’s called the “Lute of Ragnarok,” isn’t it?
sub13_010_0009;Lightning’s assessment was spot on.[~]The Lute is like Big Bridge—it’s an eidolon that’s entered into a deep sleep.
sub13_010_0010;I’m amazed you never realized what you had.[~]Buuut, if I didn’t know about it, how could you?
sub13_010_0011;Cornelia’s history goes back a long way.
sub13_010_0012;From what I understand,[~]our first king was a summoner.
sub13_010_0013;I think it’s safe to say there’s no doubt about it now.
sub13_010_0014;Well, whatever the case, our new friend[~]will need lots of magic to bust through that Cogna’s armored shell.
sub13_010_0015;Yes. But Lightning will come through for us.
