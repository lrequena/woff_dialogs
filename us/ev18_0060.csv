ev18_0060_0000;Now, the test will surely end in success.
ev18_0060_0001;Ahhh ha ha ha ha!
ev18_0060_0002;Oh.
ev18_0060_0003;Was I a quart of ingredients short?
ev18_0060_0004;Service please!
ev18_0060_0005;Lann! Ever heard of manners?
ev18_0060_0006;Who goes there?[~]Oh my. I rarely cross paths with a Jiant pair.
ev18_0060_0007;So tell me.[~]Are you the pan-mighty person from the ad?
ev18_0060_0008;Yes, that’s the gist.[~]How can I assist?
ev18_0060_0009;...The Sunken Temple?
ev18_0060_0010;Yes.
ev18_0060_0011;I dunno, maybe you could give us a magic spell?[~]You know, something that lets us breathe underwater?[~]Maybe some magic pants?
ev18_0060_0012;Breathe underwater?[~]Whether it’s gills or spells you want, a solution [f2]can[/f] be met... But,
ev18_0060_0013;the sea is its own kind of hell.[~]You’re almost certain to regret.
ev18_0060_0014;The currents will leave you blind.[~]And it’s so big you’ll be bored out of your mind.
ev18_0060_0015;Th-that’s discouraging.
ev18_0060_0016;Well, hang on.[~]We can handle a little certain regret.
ev18_0060_0017;Uh, yeah. If you know a solution,[~]then we’d really appreciate it if you could help us out.
ev18_0060_0018;So c’mon. Please?
ev18_0060_0019;Hm. Well, if you’re quite certain that that is your desire,[~]perhaps you’re just what I require...
ev18_0060_0020;’Scuse me?
ev18_0060_0021;Excellent! We’ll start with the dunce.[~]You see, you can’t do two total losers at once.
ev18_0060_0023;Urk! Can’t...breathe...
ev18_0060_0025;Huh? Lann?! Hey![~]What’s wrong? What did you do to him?!
ev18_0060_0026;There, there.[~]He simply can no longer breathe air.
ev18_0060_0027;Why not?
ev18_0060_0028;Oh, come now, darling, use your head.
ev18_0060_0029;You wanted to swim like the fishes, you said.[~]But a fish out of water is soon to be dead.
ev18_0060_0030;Are you some kind of murderer?!
ev18_0060_0031;Oh my... After I do you a favor,[~]this is how you choose to repay me?
ev18_0060_0032;My dear...don’t make me angry.
