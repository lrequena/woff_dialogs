ev01_0018_0000;Cool! I can see the chocochick[~]running around in the prismarium!
ev01_0018_0001;Pretty the-neat, huh?[~]Next, why the-don’t you have a go[~]at “stacking” that chocochick on your head?
ev01_0018_0002;DELETED
ev01_0018_0003;Here, watch, I’ll the-show you!
ev01_0018_0004;DELETED
ev01_0018_0005;Oh, now I get it! So when I saw you perched[~]on Lann’s head back in Nine Wood Hills,[~]that’s what you call “stacking.”
ev01_0018_0006;Yup, that’s the-right![~]While I’m up the-here,[~]I get to take it nice and the-easy.
ev01_0018_0007;Uh, is that stacking or slacking?
ev01_0018_0008;When you create a stack, the HP of everyone[~]in the stack gets the-added together.[~]Like they say, strength in the-numbers!
ev01_0018_0009;DELETED
ev01_0018_0010;Oh! So it’s like combining into a super-robot!
ev01_0018_0011;Better the-yet, your magic and other abilities[~]have the potential to change, too.[~]It all depends on how your stack is the-configured!
ev01_0018_0012;Huh? Oh, I don’t need any action figures[~]when I get to blast out super-attacks[~]like a super-robot!
ev01_0018_0013;Well, just be the-careful. Stacking doesn’t[~]the-make you invincible. Some the-enemy attacks[~]have the power to [f2]un[/f]stack you.
ev01_0018_0014;In other words: bye-bye, super-robot, so to speak.
ev01_0018_0015;Yowzers. That [f2]does[/f] sound like bad news.
ev01_0018_0016;It’s true that we are individually the-weaker[~]when we’re unstacked, but look on the bright the-side.[~]Since we each get our own the-turn in battle,
ev01_0018_0017;we can use the extra moves to have one member[~]attack and another the-heal. It can be very the-helpful.
ev01_0018_0017_2;Depending on the situation,[~]you might even the-decide[~]to unstack yourselves by choice.
ev01_0018_0018;Think the-carefully,[~]and choose the best setup for the job.
