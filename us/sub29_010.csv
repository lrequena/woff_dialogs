sub29_010_0001;It’s just one thing after another...[~]Sure, I expected to deal with more of them, but this many?[~]If I’m not careful, I might actually get stressed out, Shelke.

sub29_010_0003;Well, we...certainly can’t have that, can we![~]Right, alert the Black Mages! We’re going to the Eye of the Desert!
sub29_010_0004;Just incredible... <QUOT>Legendary<QUOT> doesn’t even begin to describe it.
