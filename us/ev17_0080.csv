ev17_0080_0000;So, who are they?
ev17_0080_0001;Celes. These kids...are the Jiants from the Hills.
ev17_0080_0002;You don’t mean, from the prophecy?
ev17_0080_0003;Um, you think you could fill us in[~]on what’s been going on here?
ev17_0080_0004;Sure. Where to begin...
ev17_0080_0005;So that anchor appeared out of nowhere,[~]then the Mirages?
ev17_0080_0006;Yeah. The League of S sent me here.[~]I was supposed to just be investigating the anchor.
ev17_0080_0007;But by the time he arrived,[~]the vampires were already running amok.
ev17_0080_0008;I’m told that it was utter chaos.
ev17_0080_0009;Um... You didn’t see it?
ev17_0080_0010;I’m a hired sword. And my job in Tometown is to guard this place,[~]the Library of the Ancients.
ev17_0080_0011;So, rarely do I find myself stepping outside.
ev17_0080_0012;And, it’s always quiet here.
ev17_0080_0013;Nothing seemed amiss—[~]at least not until the town had already been overtaken.
ev17_0080_0014;Hey, Celes. Where’s...
ev17_0080_0015;Oh. He was over there read—[~]How strange.
ev17_0080_0016;Cid! Are you here?
ev17_0080_0017;Ciiid! If you don’t answer me,[~]I am going to burn all of these books.
ev17_0080_0018;Wait, wait!
ev17_0080_0019;Those ghastly threats are so unbecoming.
ev17_0080_0020;Huh?!
ev17_0080_0021;Gah! A talking weird thing!
ev17_0080_0022;The-what if it’s a Mirage?
ev17_0080_0023;I often wonder the same thing.
ev17_0080_0024;How incredibly rude. I am just as human as you.[~]Just because I sometimes have a habit of—
ev17_0080_0025;BOO-GAH!
ev17_0080_0026;Ahhh!
ev17_0080_0027;Wh-whoa!
ev17_0080_0028;Hwah!
ev17_0080_0029;Ha!
ev17_0080_0030;BLERP!
ev17_0080_0031;Yes, he does have a habit of going haywire,[~]and it’s my job to calm him down.
ev17_0080_0032;What? “Calm him down”?[~]If anything, he looks more [f2]broken[/f] down than—
ev17_0080_0033;I’m baaack!
ev17_0080_0034;Aaah!
ev17_0080_0035;Yes, well, it’s far harder to break than you’d think.[~]Trust me.
ev17_0080_0036;I’ll thank you not to refer to me as an—
ev17_0080_0037;Yes milord. May we continue with our conversation now?
ev17_0080_0038;Hm? Oh yes, where were we?
ev17_0080_0039;Oh, you’re like a book freak. What did you do?[~]Make a body that doesn’t sleep just so you could keep reading forever?
ev17_0080_0040;Oh no no, please, you have it very wrong.[~]I prefer the term “bibliophile,” thank you very much.
ev17_0080_0041;[f2]That’s[/f] the part that’s wrong?
ev17_0080_0042;As I understand it, someone just happened to leave that body[~]he’s in lying around, and somehow his soul got embedded in it.
ev17_0080_0042_02;His soul’s in bed?!
ev17_0080_0043;Hwooow! I guess in a way,[~]you [f2]are[/f] human deep the-down!
ev17_0080_0043_02;Maybe his soul needs to get [f2]out[/f] of bed! Ha ha ha!
ev17_0080_0044;I told you I’m human in every conceivable way.
ev17_0080_0045;No, you really, really aren’t. Aha ha ha!
ev17_0080_0046;And what about you then? You say you’re the Jiants from the Hills?[~]Now that right there is the [f2]real[/f] stretch. I mean, what a hoot.
ev17_0080_0047;A...what-a-what?
ev17_0080_0048;Oh! Ha ha! Tama’s not an owl.
ev17_0080_0049;I mean, it [f2]is[/f] an easy mistake.[~]But wouldn’t you assume she’s a skunk or something first?
ev17_0080_0050;You... You... You... How dare you call me the-stinky again![~]That is the last the-straw!
ev17_0080_0051;I am the-[f2]fragrant[/f].[~]Roses line up just to get the-one whiff of [f2]me![/f]
ev17_0080_0052;What really the-stinks[~]is your whole stupid existence!
ev17_0080_0053;You don’t have to be ashamed of people thinking you’re skunky.[~]Skunks are cool, okay?
ev17_0080_0054;Time out. Wildlife coolness aside,
ev17_0080_0055;could you not derail every conversation[~]just because you don’t know how to vocabulary?!
ev17_0080_0056;But Reynn, vocabulary’s not a verb!
ev17_0080_0057;It is if I say so! I’ll vocab any way I want to![~]So can it before I vocab [f2]you[/f] in the lary!
ev17_0080_0058;Uh...
ev17_0080_0059;Ah, I see now. You’re comedians. Bravo.
ev17_0080_0060;Enough. We have more important things to discuss.
ev17_0080_0061;Okay, let’s get right down to it.[~]Those people back there with the fangs? What is the deal with them?
ev17_0080_0062;Wow! Right down to business.
ev17_0080_0063;Whew...
ev17_0080_0064;Vampires. They used to be people like us,[~]until a vampire bite turned them.
ev17_0080_0065;Huh?
ev17_0080_0066;Now wait. Don’t tell me that people can turn into Mirages?
ev17_0080_0067;And...and they can’t the-go back to the way they were?
ev17_0080_0068;Oh, well while we’re going back,[~]when I was younger and even handsomer I—
ev17_0080_0069;Ulp! I mean, uh...[~]Oh yes, I remember clearly now.
ev17_0080_0070;According to several books I have read,
ev17_0080_0071;those who have become vampires can be cured [f2]provided[/f]...[~]the vampire that sucked their blood is vanquished before it’s too late.
ev17_0080_0072;So then, all we have to do is move fast[~]and take out the vampires that did the biting?
ev17_0080_0073;That’s the basic idea.[~]But of course, those vampires used to be just as human as their victims.
ev17_0080_0074;So if we’re not careful about it, wouldn’t we end up sacrificing[~]as many lives as we manage to save in the end?
ev17_0080_0075;Although, we could always pick off the illiterate vampires first. You’re not[~]really living anyway if you’ve never known the comfort of a good book.
ev17_0080_0076;Uh, no, I don’t think that makes you eligible for a slaying.[~]But...point taken. We can’t save everyone.
ev17_0080_0077;Then...dude. What are we supposed to do?
ev17_0080_0078;What if we defeated the [f2]first[/f] vampire?[~]The one who started the whole thing?
ev17_0080_0079;The first?
ev17_0080_0080;That’s it![~]If you trace the epidemic back, there [f2]has[/f] to be a first.
ev17_0080_0081;Yes. Let’s call that one the “Prime.”[~]If we defeat the Prime, then the rest...
ev17_0080_0082;Hey, yeah! It should cause a ripple effect and fix everyone.
ev17_0080_0083;We would be vanquishing the bitees’ biters’ biter.
ev17_0080_0084;What do you think? Will it work, Cid?
ev17_0080_0085;Well, it hasn’t been particularly long since the commotion started, so...[~]Yes, I believe that it could.
ev17_0080_0086;Excellent! What a plan![~]...Did you follow that, Tama?
ev17_0080_0087;Wha?! Uh, of course I the-did!
ev17_0080_0088;Uh, y-yeah, me too! I was just checking.
ev17_0080_0089;All right. So where can we find the Prime?
ev17_0080_0090;Let’s see... Cloud, when you fight the vampires off,[~]have you noticed any patterns to where they seem to go?
ev17_0080_0091;Hmm... I never gave it much thought, but now that you mention it,[~]they always seem to retreat to the north.
ev17_0080_0092;Ah! Well, that points to one place.
ev17_0080_0093;That’s right... The graveyard with all the abandoned Mirage trains.[~][f2]That’s[/f] their lair.
ev17_0080_0094;Then let’s not waste any more time. We should go.
ev17_0080_0095;Wait, Cloud. Who’s going to help the townspeople?[~]I have to stay here.
ev17_0080_0096;You wouldn’t want me to go BZEEEK and make a big old mess.
ev17_0080_0097;Which is exactly the reason [f2]why[/f] I have to stay here.
ev17_0080_0098;So, he’s a big pain in the royal the-butt [f2]and[/f] certifiably useless!
ev17_0080_0099;Ha ha ha!
ev17_0080_0100;Okay, putting aside how completely not funny that is...[~]We can go to the graveyard for you. Right?
ev17_0080_0101;Huh? Uh, yeah! Vampire shmampire.[~]You just go ahead and point us at any old Mirage...
ev17_0080_0102;And we’ll the-do the rest!
ev17_0080_0103;Hmm. All right then. I guess.
ev17_0080_0104;Let’s see what the fabled Jiants can do.
