sub17_011_0000;Hey! What’re you doin’ here?
sub17_011_0001;Oh! Tidus, perfect timing![~]Do you know where Dr. Shantotto might be?
sub17_011_0002;You need the doc? She’s out taking an extended swim.[~]Drank that concoction of hers and went to the temple.
sub17_011_0003;The [f2]Sunken[/f] Temple?
sub17_011_0004;She dove right in with this ear-to-ear grin and was all like “Ahhh ha ha ha ha!”[~]And here I thought she hated swimming.
sub17_011_0005;Well, hope we didn’t come all the way down here for nothing.
sub17_011_0006;Kee kee!
sub17_011_0007;Huh? Ohhh![~]So Lady Jiant has returned for another visit.
sub17_011_0008;It’s the-nice to see you again!
sub17_011_0009;Quacho-cho!
sub17_011_0010;Qua-cho!
sub17_011_0011;Ah yes, the fluffy Mirage. Very good then.
sub17_011_0012;Marvelous timing.
sub17_011_0013;’Sup.
sub17_011_0014;Qua-chooo?! Wh-who invited the man-thing?
sub17_011_0015;Uh, my bad?
sub17_011_0016;Chowaaa!
sub17_011_0017;I feel an unusual giddy sensation. Enough![~]Man-thing is to keep its distance from me!
sub17_011_0018;Oh-kay...
sub17_011_0019;Reynn, was it? The Lady Jiant’s name?[~]Reynn-person must listen.
sub17_011_0020;Um, sure.
sub17_011_0021;Quacho, quacho!
sub17_011_0022;Kee kee kee!
sub17_011_0023;Well, I have decided I must run away!
sub17_011_0024;But, run away? Why?
sub17_011_0025;Alas, I am not even certain.
sub17_011_0026;I heard “Ahhh ha ha ha ha!” and this human person appeared[~]who then made an attempt on my royal life!
sub17_011_0027;I mean—those wretched tonberries—[~]they were finally behaving—
sub17_011_0028;Everything was fine—the Quachos—[~]we were getting on with our lives—
sub17_011_0029;And I just thought—[~]I thought I could have some peace, and quiet—
sub17_011_0030;Tell me![~]Why do humans find such sport in picking on meee?
sub17_011_0031;Um, please try to calm down.
sub17_011_0032;Qua-chooo...
sub17_011_0033;Hey, Lann? “Ahhh ha ha ha ha”...[~]That’s gotta be Dr. Shantotto, right?
sub17_011_0034;Oh, there is [f2]no[/f] doubt about that.
sub17_011_0035;Waaah! Human bullies!
sub17_011_0036;Don’t worry! Because...Lann here,[~]he’s gonna teach that mean human-person a lesson.[~]Okay? Please don’t cry.
sub17_011_0037;Dude, what?!
sub17_011_0038;Quacho?!
sub17_011_0039;He will?
sub17_011_0040;Ulp! Uh...[~]Sure. No problem!
sub17_011_0041;Qua-chaaa!
sub17_011_0042;Chowaaa![~]I’m feeling that same sensation again!
sub17_011_0043;Keecho? Chowa!
sub17_011_0044;Qua-choooooo!
sub17_011_0045;Um, what?
sub17_011_0046;Look, a girl’s heart is a complicated thing.
sub17_011_0047;That is so the-true.[~]She’s not the only girl who’s got it the-rough.
sub17_011_0048;Huh? Who? Where?[~]Another girl? ...Dude.
sub17_011_0049;Ooh! Don’t you the-pretend I’m not a fox![~]You’re such a big stupid fat-the-headed dum-dum!
