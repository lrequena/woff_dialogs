ev20_0020_0000;Huh? You mean we...won?
ev20_0020_0001;Honk YEAH![~]And here I thought that was gonna be hard.
ev20_0020_0002;That was the-mazing! Think of all the people across the-Grymoire[~]that you just saved from their plight!
ev20_0020_0003;Yeah, but I bet those nutcases who sided[~]with the Federation are gonna sweat.
ev20_0020_0004;......
ev20_0020_0005;Oh, right![~]Reynn, come on! We gotta bust Mom out.
ev20_0020_0006;Oh, right.[~]But, how do we open it?
ev20_0020_0007;You again?
ev20_0020_0008;Activate it.
ev20_0020_0009;Huh? Sorry?
ev20_0020_0010;Only Mirage Keepers are permitted to use that mighty portal—[~]the Ultima Gate.
ev20_0020_0011;With the Ultima Gate, the power of the crystals becomes yours to control.[~]Opening a mere cage would be no challenge at all.
ev20_0020_0012;......!
ev20_0020_0013;......!
ev20_0020_0014;I think I’m...starting to remember...
ev20_0020_0015;The portal... It started to shine...[~]And then the cage appeared.
ev20_0020_0016;Then, that means this isn’t your the-first time seeing it!
ev20_0020_0017;Yeah... It’s hazy, but I’ve seen this gate before.
ev20_0020_0018;Then you know what to do. Use it.
ev20_0020_0019;W-wait! Who [f2]are[/f] you?
ev20_0020_0020;......
ev20_0020_0021;......?!
ev20_0020_0022;Reynn, why must you cause Lady Lusse so many headaches?
ev20_0020_0023;What? But I didn’t do anything bad at all![~]You shouldn’t go saying stuff like that about me, okay Hauyn?
ev20_0020_0024;Hey! What’d I tell you? We’re like sisters.[~]Since you and I are close, why don’t you call me Wyn?
ev20_0020_0025;Hee hee! Okay, I will, Wyn.
ev20_0020_0026;That’s our...sister...
ev20_0020_0027;What? Did you just say...“our sister”?
ev20_0020_0028;I didn’t know you had an older the-sister!
ev20_0020_0029;Let’s reminisce later. Save Lady Lusse.
ev20_0020_0030;So then, that really [f2]is[/f] our mom in the cage?
ev20_0020_0031;Well, okay then. Let’s hurry up and[~]activate that Ultima Gate thingamajig and bust the cage open!
ev20_0020_0032;R-right!
ev20_0020_0033;Mom!
ev20_0020_0034;Mom!
ev20_0020_0035;The prophecy...has ended in crimson...
ev20_0020_0035_1;......
ev20_0020_0035_2;......
ev20_0020_0036;Mom!
ev20_0020_0037;Huh?
ev20_0020_0038;Hweh?!
ev20_0020_0039;Huh?!
ev20_0020_0039_1;Wh-what? How can this...
ev20_0020_0040;Hwah?!
ev20_0020_0041;How could you do this...twice?
ev20_0020_0042;Whaaat?!
ev20_0020_0043;What do you mean?
ev20_0020_0044;You opened it again.
ev20_0020_0045;Ha ha ha ha ha![~]The Crimson Prophecy has been fulfilled!
ev20_0020_0046;A ridiculous piece of theater, but well done.
ev20_0020_0047;I commend you all.[~]You may dispense with the illusion now, Ywain.
ev20_0020_0048;I thought Segwarides’ laborious narrative might never end.
ev20_0020_0049;I share that sentiment.[~]Should we do this again, you will keep your prophecy more concise.
ev20_0020_0050;Hee hee hee hee! But you cannot accuse me of excess.[~]Every step was necessary to the plan.
ev20_0020_0051;Hee hee hee ha ha!
ev20_0020_0052;Tell me, what of the soul crystal?[~]How much of the populace have we harvested?
ev20_0020_0053;If I had to offer up a guess,[~]then just about four souls in every ten.
ev20_0020_0054;Is that all?[~]After a whole century?
ev20_0020_0055;I have been selective, and discreet. With Champions awakening again,[~]we’re lucky to have pulled off such a feat. Hee hee hee hee!
ev20_0020_0056;NOT USED
ev20_0020_0057;What is going on...?[~]Reynn, tell me what’s happening!
ev20_0020_0058;How am I supposed to know?
ev20_0020_0059;Wyn, what is this?[~]What’s going on?
ev20_0020_0060;......
ev20_0020_0061;Aaah!
ev20_0020_0062;Aaah!
ev20_0020_0063;Aaah!
ev20_0020_0064;Aaah!
ev20_0020_0065;Now what is it?!
ev20_0020_0066;Aaah! We-we’ve really the-done it now!
ev20_0020_0067;Done [f2]what?![/f]
ev20_0020_0068;I know you.[~]You’re the...the...the Order of the Circle!
ev20_0020_0069;Ah! I have not heard that name in some time.
ev20_0020_0070;Were we acquainted in those ages past?
ev20_0020_0071;If so, she would have served our enemy.
ev20_0020_0072;Then you know what comes next.[~]We shall finally bring the Cogna into this world!
ev20_0020_0073;Nooo![~]Wh-wh-wh-what are we the-gonna do?!
ev20_0020_0074;NOT USED
ev20_0020_0075;Lann! Reynn! You’ve gotta—[~]you’ve gotta the-hurry up and do something quick!
ev20_0020_0076;NOT USED
ev20_0020_0077;Tama! You’ve got to calm down!
ev20_0020_0078;How can we do something?[~]We don’t even know what’s going on!
ev20_0020_0079;No. No...[~]The world is the-finished...
ev20_0020_0080;T-Tama?!
ev20_0020_0081;Rrrgh!
ev20_0020_0081_1;What in the holy mother of [f2]honks?![/f]
ev20_0020_0082;I’m here. Sorry I’m late.
ev20_0020_0083;The Champions have rallied here to try and intervene[~]before things go awry.
ev20_0020_0084;Too late. The Cogna have passed through the portal.[~]The fateful arrow has been loosed.
ev20_0020_0085;Rejoice! For the end of an A-World—[~]No! The beginning of something greater is now upon us!
ev20_0020_0086;It’s time to go!
ev20_0020_0087;Go how?!
ev20_0020_0088;Jump down!
ev20_0020_0089;They’re here. C’mon!
ev20_0020_0090;Let us take care of them!
ev20_0020_0091;Okay!
ev20_0020_0092;Thanks.
ev20_0020_0093;Lann, you get our sister!
ev20_0020_0094;Uh...okay!
ev20_0020_0094_1;......!
ev20_0020_0095;See ya!
ev20_0020_0096;W-we’re really doing this? Dude!
ev20_0020_0097;Jump already!
ev20_0020_0098;Wh— Aaah!
ev20_0020_0099;Couldn’t have timed [f2]that[/f] better.
ev20_0020_0100;I hate gravity...
ev20_0020_0101;It’s a good thing I actually caught you.
ev20_0020_0102;Whoa! The lass in glasses!
ev20_0020_0103;Hey! We meet aga—[~]Wait, what did you call me?
ev20_0020_0104;Oh, uh... Captain Faris called you that once.[~]I think he’s just mimicking her.
ev20_0020_0105;Yup!
ev20_0020_0106;Who asked that pirate?
ev20_0020_0107;Anyway, we never did get to thank you.[~]You were so helpful when...we...
ev20_0020_0108;Hm?
ev20_0020_0109;Well, I don’t want to sound ungrateful.[~]Your fastcraft [f2]did[/f] get us to the Low Seas, but...
ev20_0020_0110;Now, whenever I hear rushing water[~]I remember what it was like almost dying and...[~]Yeah, you really scarred me for life.
ev20_0020_0111;Oh-oh yeah? Well![~]Why don’t you tell me about it inside?
ev20_0020_0112;Whoa, check it out! Does the whole building float?[~]This place is chocobaceous!
ev20_0020_0113;Amazed me the first time I saw it too.
ev20_0020_0114;This is it.[~]Home base for the League of S.
ev20_0020_0115;Balamb Garden.
