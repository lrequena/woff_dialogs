npc_wol_0000_0000;We can begin any time.
npc_wol_0000_0001;All is quiet for the moment.
npc_wol_0000_0002;Don’t worry about us. I’ll take care of things here.
npc_wol_0000_0003;Agents from the League of S have arrived here to help us.
npc_wol_0000_0004;I can handle things here.
npc_wol_0000_0005;These Cogna...
npc_wol_0000_0006;Forgive me, but my place is here. I hope you understand.
npc_wol_0000_0007;Ever since the operation, the Federation’s been quiet.
npc_wol_0000_0008;The goblins have been laying low, too. But still, we mustn’t lower our guard.
npc_wol_0001_0000;The other day I made the foolish decision of going to check on the goblins...
npc_wol_0001_0001;But...I would prefer not to talk about it.
npc_wol_0002_0000;Yes, I heard the news. You must have been through a lot.
npc_wol_0002_0001;But thanks to your efforts, Cornelia has managed to set up a meeting with the League of S’s contact.
npc_wol_0002_0002;We are in your debt.
