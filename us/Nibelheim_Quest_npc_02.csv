Nibelheim_Quest_npc_02_A_01;Hey...you’re the Jiants from the Hills, aren’t you? Is there any way you could lend me a hand?
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_02_A_02;Recently, a group of dangerous Mirages has appeared near town. We’re all in a bind.
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_02_A_03;Can you get rid of them for us? We don’t stand a chance against them ourselves.
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_02_B_01;Really? Thanks so much!
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_02_B_02;You’ll find the Mirages lurking around Valley Seven.
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_02_B_03;It’s not just one Mirage, but a whole pack of them out there. Good luck.
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_02_C;You can’t? Ugh... Well, let me know if you change your mind.
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_02_D;Oh? Have you changed your mind?
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_02_E;Give those Mirages in Valley Seven a good beating for us. We’re counting on you.
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_02_F_01;Are you telling me the Mirages are gone? All right! Thank you!
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_02_F_02;Now they’ll know to stay far away from our town!
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_02_F_03;This is for you. Thank you.
