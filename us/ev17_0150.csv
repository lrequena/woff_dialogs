ev17_0150_0000;This is the-bad![~]I think he might be the-immortal!
ev17_0150_0001;Oh, dude, Reynn! Got any ideas?
ev17_0150_0003;Uh, Reynn?
ev17_0150_0004;Rrraaahhh...

ev17_0150_0016;Nnngh...
ev17_0150_0017;A-and then I said to the chocobo,[~]“You feather cut that out...”
ev17_0150_0018;Good work.[~]Looks like she’s gonna pull through now—her [f2]and[/f] the town.
ev17_0150_0019;Thanks to you.[~]Dude, way to come prepared!
ev17_0150_0020;Thank Cid. He found out that to defeat the Prime,[~]we’d need a wooden stake from a tree that’s been alive longer than him.
ev17_0150_0021;That took some hunting. I just looked for the oldest tree I could find.[~]Made it just in time.
ev17_0150_0022;*Yaaawwwn*[~]Good morning, Lann.
ev17_0150_0023;Oh, hey! Mornin’.
ev17_0150_0024;...Huh? Cloud’s here?
ev17_0150_0025;Huh?! Wait. What?! I was...I was attacked by the Prime...[~]And then I-I-I...!
ev17_0150_0026;Dude, no!
ev17_0150_0027;Dude, yes.[~]Seeing you with fangs was cree-[f2]pay[/f]...
ev17_0150_0028;Huh?
ev17_0150_0029;Hip-the-hurray![~]That’s three out of the-four keys in the bag!
ev17_0150_0030;The Prime must have been holding on to it.[~]Except, this key...
ev17_0150_0031;What about it?
ev17_0150_0032;I don’t know...[~]What is it you think these keys are gonna unlock?
ev17_0150_0033;Huh? Well, they’re keys, so...a door, I guess?
ev17_0150_0034;......
ev17_0150_0035;Nah. I’m overthinking it.[~]Never mind.
ev17_0150_0036;Oh! Cloud! I never thanked you!
ev17_0150_0037;Thanks again!
ev17_0150_0038;Don’t do anything you’re gonna regret later on.
