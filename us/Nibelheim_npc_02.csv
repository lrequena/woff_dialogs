Nibelheim_npc_02_A;We don’t need the Federation! We can get along just fine by ourselves.
Nibelheim_npc_02_B_01;Those SOLDIERs that Shinra hired are doing their best to keep those machines at bay.
Nibelheim_npc_02_B_02;But that’s not right! This place is our home! We need to step up and fight for it ourselves!
Nibelheim_npc_02_C_01;As you can see, we’re totally fine! Those machines never knew what hit ’em! Heh heh heh!
Nibelheim_npc_02_C_02;Uh, not that I was doing much of the hitting, I’m afraid...
Nibelheim_npc_02_C_03;Man, Shinra sure is something else. Maybe I should sign up for SOLDIER myself.
