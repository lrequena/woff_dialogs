ev17_0175_0000;Hey Cid, since the town’s got one of those anchor things, doesn’t that mean you guys are part of the Federation now?
ev17_0175_0001;Really? That would certainly be news to me.
ev17_0175_0002;Huh? What do you mean?
ev17_0175_0003;What do [f2]you[/f] mean, you mean.
ev17_0175_0004;As far as I know, we drove those yahoos off, whatever it was they thought they were selling.
ev17_0175_0005;So then, what? They took over Tometown by force?
ev17_0175_0006;Hwah? So, the vampires were all part of some bigger the-plan?
ev17_0175_0007;What?! Oh no no no, they would never—
ev17_0175_0008;YES THEY WOULD! Hm, when did the Federation become such thugs?
ev17_0175_0009;You mean, it wasn’t like that before?
ev17_0175_0010;Oh, well they were certainly very coercive, but—I’ve never heard of anything quite like this.
ev17_0175_0011;Well, we have. Bahamut sent a whole horde of goblins to invade Cornelia.
ev17_0175_0013;Really? Well, you don’t say. Hmm... That’s just a little bit unsettling.
