General_Town_Quest_npc_02_A_01;Hey, hey, did you know about the nimble Mirages living in the desert? They’re really fast!
General_Town_Quest_npc_02_A_02;I’d really like to run a race against them one of these days, but... Well, they’re Mirages, right?
General_Town_Quest_npc_02_A_03;I don’t want to start a race with them only to have them attack me, so I was hoping you could check out how strong they are for me first!
General_Town_Quest_npc_02_A_04;Oh, they’re called cactuars! If you can defeat a handful of them for me, then I’ll be able to tell how strong they are!
General_Town_Quest_npc_02_B;Oh boy, I can’t wait to find out how fast those Mirages really are!
General_Town_Quest_npc_02_C_01;Whoa! You defeated some?! How were they?
General_Town_Quest_npc_02_C_02;Hmm. It sounds like I should be okay if I challenge one to a race!
General_Town_Quest_npc_02_C_03;I’m gonna go throw down with one right now! Oh, yeah, this is for you!
General_Town_Quest_npc_02_D;Okay, so in order to find one, I’ve gotta be ready to wander around the desert, right? Let’s see...
General_Town_Quest_npc_02_E;Just wait! I’m gonna be the fastest runner that ever lived!
