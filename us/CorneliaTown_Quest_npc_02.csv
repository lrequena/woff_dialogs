Cornelia_Quest_npc_02_A_01;Oh! If it isn’t the Jiants! I’ve heard you’ve been putting up a grand fight against the Bahamutian Army.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_02_A_02;I hope you don’t mind, but I have a favor I’d like to ask you.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_02_A_03;As I’m sure you know, the goblins that once served the Bahamutian Army have gone and taken up residence in the Watchplains.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_02_A_04;We would like to observe them in their natural state, but I’m afraid they’re too dangerous for us to handle ourselves.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_02_A_05;Could we ask you to defeat a few of them for us? That would help us to gather the data we need.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_02_A_06;Oh, don’t worry, we won’t get in your way. We can observe your battles with the goblins from a distance and collect all the data we need. So, what do you say? Will you help us?
Cornelia_Quest_npc_02_B;That’s great! Thanks for agreeing to help with our study.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_02_C_01;This is great! Thanks to you, we were able to gather the data we need.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_02_C_02;Please accept this as a reward.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_02_D;It seems that as long as we keep our distance from the plains, the goblins will keep their distance from us.
