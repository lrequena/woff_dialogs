ev21_0020_0000;Here’s the latest.
ev21_0020_0001;There you have it.
ev21_0020_0002;No juicy rumors from the old RR this time.
ev21_0020_0003;Where do you want to check for rumors?
ev21_0020_0004;Around Cornelia
ev21_0020_0005;Around Nibelheim
ev21_0020_0006;Around Figaro
ev21_0020_0007;Around Tometown
ev21_0020_0008;Around Besaid
ev21_0020_0009;Did you hear?! A strange, four-legged machine is closing in on Cornelia! The Warrior of Light and that tough-looking lady with the pink hair were talking about some kind of plan to keep the threat at bay, but what if it doesn’t work? I can hardly sleep at night...
ev21_0020_0010;Get a load of this! Some kind of creepy machine is tearing the landscape up right outside of Nibelheim! SOLDIER’s out there trying to take it down, but it sounds like they’ve barely made a dent in the thing. Not even that guy with the big sword and the young lady in the cowboy hat have been able to stop it.
ev21_0020_0011;I don’t know where they came from, but a bunch of strange machines have taken over the desert! One of our merchants would have died if King Edgar and the castle guard hadn’t come to the rescue. Figaro’s putting up a good fight, but there are just so [f2]many[/f]. If only we knew what was controlling them...
ev21_0020_0012;You’ll never believe it. There’s been another sighting of that spooky runaway train! Where does it come from? Where does it go? I’m too scared to set foot outside my door. Cid and Celes have been racking their brains trying to figure out what makes it tick. But if they don’t stop it soon, I think Tometown might end up going tome-down...
ev21_0020_0013;Where did that flying mechanical monstrosity come from? It’s been dive-bombing people left and right. My goodness, I just hope it moves on soon and leaves Besaid alone. How are we supposed to fight off something we can’t even reach?
