ev19_0065_0000;Wait. Hey Reynn,[~]don’t these kind of remind you of the keys we collected?
ev19_0065_0001;Wha? Oh, yeah, you’re right.
ev19_0065_0002;Maybe the keys keep them[~]from falling into the wrong the-hands?
ev19_0065_0003;Oh dude! I’ve got the right hands.[~]I’m [f2]so[/f] worthy to use them!
ev19_0065_0004;Hngh!
ev19_0065_0005;Nnnnnngh!
ev19_0065_0006;Cut me some slack, sword!
ev19_0065_0007;Weird...[~]Are these weapons even meant to be used?
ev19_0065_0008;Given their size,[~]it does seem kind of the-strange.
ev19_0065_0009;You do have a point.[~]Even Cloud would have trouble swinging around one of these.
ev19_0065_0010;And look. They have the same light as the quadrelemence barrier.[~]It’s possible that they’re locked down by the same forces.
ev19_0065_0011;Then I guess first[~]we’ll have to the-deal with those four elemental locks.
ev19_0065_0012;All right, let’s get this show on the road!
