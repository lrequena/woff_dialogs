ev21_0150_0000;As postscripts go...impressive...[~]Aha ha ha!
ev21_0150_0001;(19 seconds of CRYING)
ev21_0150_0002;No more frowning.[~]Now, let’s smile.
ev21_0150_0003;You should turn those corners up, or your happiness will spill right out.[~]You don’t want that to happen.
ev21_0150_0004;But, everybody makes fun of me[~]because they say my arm is creepy.
ev21_0150_0005;But look. Mommy’s are the same. See?
ev21_0150_0006;And there’s more. Did you know that these arms are very special?[~]They’re proof of the joy you’ll bring the world.
ev21_0150_0007;But...only one of my hands looks like yours.
ev21_0150_0008;You have one. Lann has the other.
ev21_0150_0009;So as long as you both work together,[~]there’s no happiness you can’t attain.
ev21_0150_0010;Please, you have to stop gathering so many Mirages.
ev21_0150_0011;Why’s that? We’re really good at it.[~]You of all people should be proud.
ev21_0150_0012;Yeah. It’s a good thing.
ev21_0150_0013;You don’t have a proper handle on any of them.
ev21_0150_0014;Think of the trouble you’re making for those around you.
ev21_0150_0015;Well, what do I care?[~]It’s not any trouble for [f2]us[/f].
ev21_0150_0016;Fine, then don’t you care about your mother? The more you—[~]the more Mirages that you take away from her...
ev21_0150_0017;Oh, please. Mom loves seeing us excel.[~]Don’t even pretend it doesn’t make her happy.
ev21_0150_0018;Dad, I just think you’re jealous because[~]you don’t know how to do it.
ev21_0150_0019;Busted.
ev21_0150_0020;Just stop! You don’t realize—
ev21_0150_0021;You’re the one who said that everyone’s lives would be easier[~]if we summoned those gods or whatever. Don’t chicken out now, Wyn.
ev21_0150_0022;Yeah, remember?[~]Why else would we even be up here?
ev21_0150_0023;You’re wrong![~]A path to another world will—
ev21_0150_0024;Just shut the honk up.[~]Oh! I know what to do with you.
ev21_0150_0025;Hup!
ev21_0150_0026;What?
ev21_0150_0027;Lann, Reynn, stop this!
ev21_0150_0028;Don’t!
ev21_0150_0029;You don’t know what you’re doing![~]This is wrong!
ev21_0150_0030;Are you the one who summoned me?
ev21_0150_0031;Aaah!
ev21_0150_0032;What is going on?
ev21_0150_0033;......!
ev21_0150_0034;Hey! Who are you?!
ev21_0150_0035;Children! Get over here!
ev21_0150_0036;......!
ev21_0150_0037;......!
ev21_0150_0038;(EFFORT as she puts herself in front of her children)
ev21_0150_0039;Answer me! Who are yo—
ev21_0150_0040;Aaah!
ev21_0150_0041;Rorrik!
ev21_0150_0042;(DRAWING her weapon)
ev21_0150_0043;Aaah!
ev21_0150_0044;(16 seconds of FLAILING her arms and legs)
ev21_0150_0045;M-Mom... Dad...
ev21_0150_0046;No... I didn’t...
ev21_0150_0047;Now these are fine vessels.[~]How astonishing for the first creatures I find to be humans of so high a caliber.
ev21_0150_0048;So. Who will join me?[~]Two bodies! Take them!
ev21_0150_0049;Aaah!!!
ev21_0150_0050;Aaah!!!
ev21_0150_0051;(STAGGERING as she holds her head)
ev21_0150_0052;You have to escape...[~]Lann...Reynn...!
ev21_0150_0053;Mom, what’s—
ev21_0150_0054;......!
ev21_0150_0055;Get away!
ev21_0150_0056;Aaah!
ev21_0150_0057;Aaah!
ev21_0150_0058;What was that?[~]What did we just see?
ev21_0150_0059;Did that...[~]Did that...happen?
ev21_0150_0060;Nnn...
ev21_0150_0061;Lady Lusse!
ev21_0150_0062;Hauyn... You’re here?
ev21_0150_0063;You’re both safe. I’m so glad.[~]So glad...
ev21_0150_0064;Are you really...our mom?
ev21_0150_0065;Reynn and Lann...[~]They lost all of their old memories when they were spliced out of Grymoire.
ev21_0150_0066;They don’t remember a thing.[~]Lucky them.
ev21_0150_0067;But that’s good...
ev21_0150_0068;Please, Hauyn...[~]Promise me...that you’ll forgive them.
ev21_0150_0069;......
ev21_0150_0070;For me.
ev21_0150_0071;I never...
ev21_0150_0072;Aaah!
ev21_0150_0073;Aaah!
ev21_0150_0074;Subtlety...[~]I can never abide it when a more direct solution is at hand.
ev21_0150_0075;Ah... Ah...!
ev21_0150_0076;Come now. Did you not have some wish?[~]Some grand desire you came here for me to grant?
ev21_0150_0077;Show me resolve. Show me ingenuity. Show me your power![~]Show me all the Mirages at your behest,[~]but do not show yourself to be lacking!
ev21_0150_0078;Wh-what are...[~]What kind of thing [f2]are[/f] you?
ev21_0150_0079;I am Brandelis! The mighty king of Bahamut,[~]and number II-5 of the Exnine Knights!
ev21_0150_0080;I am the conqueror of all A-Worlds.[~]And their destroyer!
ev21_0150_0081;No. You...[f2]you[/f]...are nothing but DUST!
