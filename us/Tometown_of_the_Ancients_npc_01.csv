Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_01_A;Welcome to Tometown. We’ve got books and...well, that’s about it, but I hope you enjoy it here.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_01_B;Where did all those monsters come from? Why are they attacking us? And how are we going to make sure they don’t destroy our precious books?
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_01_C_01;The attacks had me kind of worried, but thanks to Cid and Celes, our books are still safe and sound.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_01_C_02;I was especially impressed by how Cid stepped up. He was amazing.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_01_C_03;He took everything those machines hit him with, and kept coming back for more! I wonder how he got to be so strong.
