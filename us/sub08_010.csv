sub08_010_0000;Vivi. You have awakened as a Champion,[~]and I believe you have washed your hands of the Federation.
sub08_010_0001;However, there are many in Figaro who view an army of black mages—[~]and one that served Bahamut—with considerable suspicion.
sub08_010_0002;Can you offer us your allegiance all the same?
sub08_010_0003;Edgar, sir.[~]I know it’s just words, but...
sub08_010_0004;I’ve heard enough about what the Federation’s done[~]to understand that it’s not right.
sub08_010_0005;Maybe I can help you somehow, or maybe I can’t.
sub08_010_0006;All I can tell you is that I’m willing to try.[~]I’m going to prove myself—to you [f2]and[/f] to your people.
sub08_010_0007;Eloquently stated.[~]Yes, they’ll warm to you soon.
sub08_010_0008;King Edgar, why?![~]You’ve ordered the Black Mages on yet another mission?
sub08_010_0009;Yes. With them out in the field,[~]your men can stay here and get some much needed rest.[~]Think happy thoughts.
sub08_010_0010;You’re refusing to see the problem at all!
sub08_010_0011;I tell you, sire, you are far too trusting of them.
sub08_010_0012;Those things started out as Mirages.[~]And for all we know, they’re still spying on us!
sub08_010_0013;I’ll just have to keep an eye on them for the both of us!
sub08_010_0014;I beg of you, do not allow their cunning to win you over.[~]Stay vigilant, sire!
sub08_010_0015;Really now... Spying on us.[~]Well, Vivi should be able to weather it.
sub08_010_0016;Oh! It’s the captain! Hello, sir![~]Are you on patrol? You work so hard!
sub08_010_0017;Huh? You’re that— Listen here![~]I have a few words for you an—
sub08_010_0018;Oh yeah! Outside I found this beautiful flower![~]You can have it if you like.
sub08_010_0019;Hmm? Uh, oh...
sub08_010_0020;It’s so strange. I thought Figaro was nothing but desert.[~]But that isn’t true at all, now is it?
sub08_010_0021;And we wouldn’t have such pretty flowers[~]if the kingdom’s finest weren’t out there bravely defending the castle!
sub08_010_0022;Ah! Oops, I’m gonna be late for training![~]Pardon the intrusion, sir!
sub08_010_0023;......
sub08_010_0024;It is...a lovely flower.
sub08_010_0025;That Vivi. You just can’t help but like the kid, you know?
sub08_010_0026;Thanks to the Black Mages, Figaro’s defenses are stronger than ever.[~]We’re lucky to have ’em around.
sub08_010_0027;......
sub08_010_0028;I’m not unreasonable... And I never told[~]anyone the Black Mages aren’t capable. I just...[~]I just want everyone to play things on the safe side.
sub08_010_0029;Oh! Captain, sir. I already cleaned up around there a while ago.[~]But if it still needs work, I’ll be happy to give it another go.
sub08_010_0030;What? O-oh, is that so? Fine work, I’m sure.[~]You just run along now. Go on. Get some rest.
sub08_010_0031;Okay!
sub08_010_0032;......
sub08_010_0033;Hello there, Captain, sir!
sub08_010_0034;Oh no! Your uniform got torn.[~]Want me to stitch it up for you later?
sub08_010_0035;What? Oh, uh... Thank you.
sub08_010_0036;Wow, sir, look at your hands! They’re so huge!
sub08_010_0037;Hey, Captain.
sub08_010_0038;Heeey, Captain.
sub08_010_0039;Hey, Captain!
sub08_010_0040;Hey, [f2]Captain![/f]
sub08_010_0041;HEY, CAPTAIN!
sub08_010_0042;Hey! Captain!
sub08_010_0043;Hey, Captain?
sub08_010_0044;Aaaaaah! What has gotten into me?! I’m like a man possessed![~]I can’t get Vivi out of my head! Nnnaaagggh!
sub08_010_0045;Ugh... You know what. I’ll suck it up and just say it.[~]We need him. He’s become an indispensable member of our kingdom!
sub08_010_0046;King Edgar could see it.[~]He was completely right about the boy.
sub08_010_0047;What a resilient lad. Heh. I salute you, Vivi![~]Mine is a hard mind to change.
sub08_010_0048;King Edgar, why?![~]You’ve ordered the Black Mages on yet another mission?
sub08_010_0049;Y-yes. Considering the operation at hand,[~]I felt that their ranged magic would be the best fit.
sub08_010_0050;I understand your reservations,[~]but you need to learn to trust Vivi and the other Black Mag—
sub08_010_0051;You’re refusing to see the problem at all!
sub08_010_0052;You’re putting them in too much danger, sire![~]How can you foist all the hardest missions on them?
sub08_010_0053;Huh?
sub08_010_0054;If anything were to happen to the Black Mages,[~]it would be a devastating loss for the kingdom of Figaro!
sub08_010_0055;My men will join them, sire! Just watch! We will keep them safe.[~]Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must get ready!
sub08_010_0056;What in the world is going on?
sub08_010_0057;Edgar, the Black Mages are ready to leave at any time!
sub08_010_0058;Hmm. You are a sly one, Vivi.
sub08_010_0059;Huh?
sub08_010_0060;Oh, never mind.[~]Listen up. Today the castle guard will be deploying with you.
sub08_010_0061;Don’t let them down!
sub08_010_0062;Aye-aye!
sub08_010_0063;I knew that I was right to place my trust in them.[~]The Black Mages and Figaro are going to be fast friends.
sub08_010_0064;...Still. How [f2]did[/f] Vivi win the captain over?
