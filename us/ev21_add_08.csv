ev21_add_08_0000;Thresholds are more than just barriers, aren’t they?
ev21_add_08_0001;Technically, they’re more like a powerful force field, inside of which the world’s rules can be the-bent and great feats performed.
ev21_add_08_0002;So, whenever we step through a threshold, we’re stepping inside someone else’s private world?
ev21_add_08_0003;That’s the-right. I knew it wouldn’t take the-long for [f2]you[/f] to understand.
ev21_add_08_0004;But for someone to the-create a world this physical, this [f2]real[/f] inside their threshold, they would have to expend a tremendous the-amount of energy. Not just anyone can the-do it.
ev21_add_08_0005;All that soul crystal being sent here...
ev21_add_08_0006;Right, it’s, uh, probably doing the, um...
ev21_add_08_0007;It’s okay, Lann. You don’t have to contribute.
ev21_add_08_0008;Well, whatever form a threshold takes, we know how they work in general, so, at least we’ll be ready.
ev21_add_08_0009;That’s the-right. And you may not have the-noticed, but both of [f2]you[/f] have thresholds too.
ev21_add_08_0010;Whoa, really?
ev21_add_08_0011;Wha—but—I—the— [f2]PSHHHhhh[/f]......
ev21_add_08_0012;Hweh? I think Lann’s head is the-starting to smoke.
ev21_add_08_0013;All this info must have finally blown his mind.
