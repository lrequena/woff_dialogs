ev16_0040_0000;Getting to the top is...
ev16_0040_0001;Not gonna be fun.
ev16_0040_0002;I’ll the-say.
ev16_0040_0003;Still, you have to admire it.[~]Who could have built something like this?
ev16_0040_0004;Nobody ever [f2]built[/f] it.[~]A Jiant summoned it here in ages past.
ev16_0040_0005;The name is Eiko. My job is to look after the bridge.
ev16_0040_0006;You’ve come here to cross it, right?
ev16_0040_0007;Yeah.
ev16_0040_0008;So...you’re saying that Big Bridge isn’t man-made,[~]that someone summoned it here. But, like...
ev16_0040_0009;First, the bridge has a real name. It’s Alexander, in fact.
ev16_0040_0010;Whuh?
ev16_0040_0011;The great Mirage, Big Bridge Alexander!
ev16_0040_0012;Ah! It’s...it’s the-true! How did I the-miss it?[~]I can sense the bridge’s the-presence!
ev16_0040_0013;Dude... This thing is [f2]alive?[/f] Holy schlep!
ev16_0040_0014;And [f2]that’s[/f] why a summoner like me has to look after him.
ev16_0040_0015;Oh wow! So you’re a summoner, then!
ev16_0040_0016;Yeah, but it’s not like [f2]I’m[/f] the one that summoned him...
ev16_0040_0017;Hey, can I ask you something?
ev16_0040_0018;Hm?
ev16_0040_0019;Are you them? The one and only Jiants from the Hills?
ev16_0040_0020;You bet!
ev16_0040_0021;Yeah, that’s...the word.
ev16_0040_0022;Sooo...I guess that means it’s true.
ev16_0040_0023;Hm? Wait a second. If the prophecy is right...
ev16_0040_0024;You’d better not even think about it![~]Don’t you dare lead us down the wrong path!
ev16_0040_0025;Huh?
ev16_0040_0026;Nobody remembers ’cause they’re so caught up in the Crimson Prophecy.
ev16_0040_0027;The [f2]Azure[/f] Prophecy, it very clearly says[~]you could bring us salvation [f2]or[/f] ruin.[~]The divergent futures!
ev16_0040_0028;NOT USED
ev16_0040_0029;Oh, that’s right.[~]Princess Sarah [f2]did[/f] tell us about the divergence.
ev16_0040_0030;Wait, the what?
ev16_0040_0031;You the-mean you forgot?
ev16_0040_0032;I’m starting to worry...[~]Maybe I shouldn’t let you use the bridge.
ev16_0040_0033;Oh, no. We’re cool![~]Me and Reynn are totally going to reek the right future.
ev16_0040_0034;Sure are...
ev16_0040_0034_1;Huh?
ev16_0040_0034_2;Ahh...
ev16_0040_0035;Well, it’s not like I can stop you.[~]The prophecy’s about you, not me, right?
ev16_0040_0036;Go on. You can cross.[~]But don’t go causing the apocalypse.
ev16_0040_0037;Duly noted.
ev16_0040_0038;So is there some special the-trick[~]to getting to the tippity-top of Alexander?
ev16_0040_0039;Just get on. I’ll handle the wake-up call.
ev16_0040_0040;The what?
ev16_0040_0041;Alexander’s kind of a sound sleeper.[~]So it’s my job to step in and sort of get things going.
ev16_0040_0042;Now, off you go!
