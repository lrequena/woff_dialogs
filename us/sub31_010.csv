sub31_010_0000;Captain, Captain![~]Captain Fariiis!
sub31_010_0001;What is it, Mog?
sub31_010_0002;Oh! She’s been sighted on the Low Seas, kupo!
sub31_010_0003;Who has?
sub31_010_0004;The great sea-demon, Leviathan, kupo!
sub31_010_0005;Huh? ...Hmph, let her come.[~]I was hoping that beast would return within my lifetime.
sub31_010_0006;Syldra!
sub31_010_0007;Grrraaah!
sub31_010_0008;Today we avenge them—your family and my great-grandfather.[~]Our long wait is finally over. Are you ready?
sub31_010_0009;Grrrah!
sub31_010_0010;Right! Head for the Low Seas!
sub31_010_0011;Count me in too, kupo!
sub31_010_0012;Grrraaah!
sub31_010_0013;That’s the first and last time I come here—[~]never ever again, kupo.
sub31_010_0014;Rrrr...?
sub31_010_0015;S-stop hanging the jib. That was nothing.
sub31_010_0016;[f2]Lann and Reynn, I don’t know how you did it...[/f]
sub31_010_0017;Now! Tell me where that demon was spotted.
sub31_010_0018;In the waters of Babil,[~]not far from the Rainbow Shore, kupo!
sub31_010_0019;Leviathan! Here I am! Show yourself!
sub31_010_0020;Come out and fight![~]If you have the courage!
sub31_010_0021;What’s all this noise?[~]Who might you be?
sub31_010_0022;Hoh... So, she killed your ancestors.[~]Now, you seek revenge?
sub31_010_0023;Aye. She must pay.[~]For my great-grandfather and Syldra’s kin.
sub31_010_0024;Hmmm.[~]As you wish. I’ll call her for you.
sub31_010_0025;Must you always raise such a clamor like that![~]My ears work fine, little adamantoise.
sub31_010_0026;Can’t you see I’m trying to enjoy myself? I have missed these seas.[~]Your reason for disturbing me had best be good.
sub31_010_0027;We’re the ones who are disturbing you, Leviathan!
sub31_010_0028;Well now, what is this tiny creature?
sub31_010_0029;I’ll show you tiny!
sub31_010_0030;You killed my great-grandfather Tycoon![~]He died, with all of Syldra’s clan!
sub31_010_0031;But on this day, we will have our vengeance!
sub31_010_0032;And I’m here to help, kupo!
sub31_010_0033;Tycoon and...Syldra, did you say?
sub31_010_0034;Ohhh! Astonishing. So their bloodlines survived![~]...Hm? But hold. You say you seek vengeance upon [f2]me?[/f]
sub31_010_0035;That’s right! Don’t you dare feign ignorance!
sub31_010_0036;My great-grandfather was brave.[~]When you attacked Syldra’s family, he fought to save them...and died.
sub31_010_0037;But we swore that one day, we would have our vengeance.[~]For generations we’ve waited!
sub31_010_0038;It’s my good fortune that you appeared in my lifetime.[~]Because now, I can be the one to settle the score!
sub31_010_0039;Hmmm...
sub31_010_0040;Heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha...[~]Aha ha ha ha ha!
sub31_010_0041;Foolish girl.[~]Am I to believe a whelp like you has any chance of defeating [f2]me?[/f]
sub31_010_0042;Not a chance. Not in a thousand years![~]Ha ha ha ha ha!
