PortTown_npc_01_A_01;Aloha! Sightseeing, are we? Well, welcome to the port of Besaid! It’s not the biggest town in the world, but it [f2]is[/f] nice and laid-back.
PortTown_npc_01_A_02;You two are gonna love it here! Just kick back and relax!
PortTown_npc_01_B;Fallen in love with Besaid yet?
PortTown_npc_01_C;Man, this is the worst. How am I supposed to enjoy this awesome view with all those weird machines getting in the way?
PortTown_npc_01_D;Now that those pesky machines are finally gone, Besaid is looking as fresh as ever. Why not relax and stay a spell?
