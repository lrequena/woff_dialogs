ev08_0020_0000;Ugh... At this rate, we might as well [f2]swim[/f] to the Low Seas.
ev08_0020_0001;Well, you can’t really blame them.[~]They probably need every boat[~]they’ve got to make ends meet.
ev08_0020_0002;Wait! Hold your chocobos.[~]Didn’t somebody mention a pirate ship[~]was parked at the pier?
ev08_0020_0003;Yeah, something like that.[~]Why, what’s your point?
ev08_0020_0004;Heh heh heh. I’ve got an idea.[~]What if we beat up all the pirates[~]and then...commodore their ship?
ev08_0020_0005;What? There’s no [f2]way[/f] it’ll be that easy.
ev08_0020_0006;Well, we don’t have to go in with Mirages blazing.[~]We might just be able to sneak off with it.
ev08_0020_0007;They’re pirates, right?[~]Who’s gonna file a complaint?
ev08_0020_0008;I guess... It’s definitely risky,[~]but if we don’t get our butts in gear,
ev08_0020_0009;Refia’s Not-Uncle, or that freak in the creepy golden mask,[~]might come along and [f2]really[/f] rain on our parade.
ev08_0020_0010;Lesser of two evils it is![~]Docks, here we come!
