ev02_0050_0001;Whoa! What the... What just happened?[~]Why wasn’t I able to imprism that Mirage?
ev02_0050_0002;Didn’t you see the light the-surrounding it?[~]That means it’s the-beholden to another keeper.
ev02_0050_0003;Be-what? B.O.? They smell?
ev02_0050_0004;UGH! No! What I mean is,[~]the Mirage already has another the-master.
ev02_0050_0005;So until you give their boss the old heave-the-ho,[~]you won’t the-be able to claim it for yourself.
ev02_0050_0006;Ugh! Fire whoever wrote [f2]that[/f] little hook in.
ev02_0050_0007;Lann! Ix-nay on the fourth wall stuff!
