ev03_0024_0000;What’s this?
ev03_0024_0001;It’s the-basically the same kind of thing as the contraption we saw before with the chocobo symbol.
ev03_0024_0002;But, this one’s got nothing but a question mark on it.
ev03_0024_0003;A question the-mark means you’ll have to figure out which Mirages it will respond to on your own.
ev03_0024_0004;Sometimes it’s a secret Mirage, and the-sometimes you just need more than one kind of Mirage in order to advance.
ev03_0024_0005;But considering the creatures living here use this device to come and the-go, it’s a safe bet you’ll find the Mirages you need close the-by.
