Cornelia_Quest_npc_01_A_01;Ugh... What am I gonna do...
Cornelia_Quest_npc_01_A_02;Oh! Say, you wouldn’t happen to be the Jiants from the Hills by any chance, would you?
Cornelia_Quest_npc_01_A_03;You see, there’s a situation I’m dealing with where I could really use your assistance, since you must know Mirages so well.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_01_A_04;Could I trouble you to please bring me an earth hammer?
Cornelia_Quest_npc_01_A_05;If you could, I would be forever in your debt!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_01_B;Thank you again for doing this!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_01_C_01;Oh! You really brought me an earth hammer! I can’t tell you how much I appreciate this!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_01_C_02;Now I can ensure my helmet is always in tip-top condition! I can’t stand unsightly dents!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_01_C_03;I know it isn’t much, but, please accept this as a token of my thanks.
Cornelia_Quest_npc_01_D;My helmet fits perfectly now! What a great feeling!
Cornelia_Quest_npc_01_E;There’s nothing better than a polished and well-maintained helmet!
