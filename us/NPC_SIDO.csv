npc_sido_0000_0000;If you don’t mind, I am very busy reading.
npc_sido_0000_0001;Where was I... Buzz off now so I can BZEEEK!
npc_sido_0000_0002;The town will be safe. Celes and I are on the job.
npc_sido_0000_0003;None shall lay a finger on these books!
npc_sido_0001_0000;If a Mirage isn’t shaped like a human, then it probably never was one. Attack away guilt-free!
npc_sido_0001_0001;Hm? Oh, stop staring. You can very clearly see that I’m human.
npc_sido_0002_0000;DELETED
npc_sido_0002_0001;Ha!
npc_sido_0002_0002;KABONK!
npc_sido_0003_0000;Celes and I were born in the same town. Although, that town is long gone now.
npc_sido_0003_0001;Our town got along comparatively well with the Federation. Celes and I belonged to the militia there.
npc_sido_0003_0002;I suppose it was just one of many Federation outposts.
npc_sido_0003_0003;Unfortunately, Celes was too good of a soldier. She caught Segwarides’ eye...
npc_sido_0003_0004;I didn’t find out until much later, but she submitted herself willingly to the Federation’s experiments in order to protect my manor.
npc_sido_0003_0005;Once I learned the truth, I dashed to the cathedral and managed to rescue her...but sustained, shall we say, a mild flesh wound on the way out.
npc_sido_0003_0006;But on the plus side! I got this brand spanking new body out of it! Now I can read day and night, unburdened by sleep. Hah! Hah! Hah!
