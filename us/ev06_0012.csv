ev06_0012_0000;Ohhh! Our first guests in a while.[~]Welcome to Sherlotta’s Solace.
ev06_0012_0001;Ahh! So much warminess!
ev06_0012_0002;Oh! Um, hello there.[~]Would it be okay if we[~]rest here for a little bit?
ev06_0012_0003;Sure! The Solace wouldn’t be much of an inn[~]if we turned away freezing travelers.
ev06_0012_0004;Thank goodness.
ev06_0012_0005;Oh! We don’t see very many Jiants these days.
ev06_0012_0006;Wha— Lann, what are you—
ev06_0012_0007;Whoops! ...Oh. She doesn’t really seem all that shocked.
ev06_0012_0008;Hm? Oh, well, I’m sure some folks would make a fuss.[~]But I remember a time when Jiants[~]wouldn’t warrant a second look.
ev06_0012_0009;It’s only lately your kind has truly gotten scarce.[~]But even then I doubt anyone’s eyes[~]have been popping out.
ev06_0012_0010;Well, now that you mention it, I guess not.
ev06_0012_0011;Eh, don’t give it a second thought.[~]Everyone is welcome under my roof.
ev06_0012_0012;Although, it would help if you[~]did a little shopping before[~]you go on your merry way.
ev06_0012_0013;[f2]Good idea. I wonder if she's got[~]anything to keep us warm. That would help.[/f]
