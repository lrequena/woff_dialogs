sub28_020_0000;Oh my... And here I thought you’d win. Well, we can try this again, when you’re stronger.
sub28_020_0001;Ugh... What the honk was [f2]that[/f] about?
sub28_020_0002;I was wondering about all the ruckus.[~]What are you up to now?
sub28_020_0003;Eiko?
sub28_020_0004;Whoa whoa whoa.[~]It’s not like it’s [f2]our[/f] fault! We didn’t cause any ruckus.
sub28_020_0005;Well, someone must have woken Alexander up,[~]’cause I could hear him making all kinds of noise and—
sub28_020_0006;Huh? He’s telling me to thank you.
sub28_020_0007;Some pest was bothering him.[~]He said he was in pain until you showed up, or something like that.
sub28_020_0008;Hmm, I don’t know what that’s about. But, I guess I’d better thank you too.[~]Rescuing Alexander like that was very brave!
