ev03_add_gimmick02_0000;Don’t look at me! I didn’t do it!
ev03_add_gimmick02_0001;Nobody the-said it was your fault.
ev03_add_gimmick02_0002;Yeah, don’t try to take credit for every mistake.
ev03_add_gimmick02_0003;Dgghh...
ev03_add_gimmick02_0004;So, Tama... What went wrong this time?
ev03_add_gimmick02_0005;This time the switch seems to respond to both elements [f2]and[/f] the Mirages’ the-weight.
ev03_add_gimmick02_0006;So in other words, we need to get both of those right, huh.
ev03_add_gimmick02_0007;You might the-have to do some transfigging to find the right combination, so come the-back later when you have the right Mirage or Mirages.
ev03_add_gimmick02_0008;One of these days I’ll make a mistake that matters.
ev03_add_gimmick02_0009;No, Lann, you really the-won’t.
ev03_add_gimmick02_0010;Not in a million years.
