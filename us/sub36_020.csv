sub36_020_0000;Thaaat oughta do it.[~]Your cave will be safe now!
sub36_020_0001;Thanks, Ifrit![~]You’re the best kind of friend we could ask for!
sub36_020_0002;Look. You really have the wrong idea—
sub36_020_0003;I can’t go stealing from such a stand-up guy![~]I promise to leave your treasure alone. Okay? You keep it.
sub36_020_0004;I agree. Not after he rescued us![~]’Cause that would just be bad form.
sub36_020_0005;Err... It is true![~]Your, uh...your burning passion has moved me!
sub36_020_0006;I could not allow your fires to be snuffed out.[~]And just so you both know, there was never any treasure here to begin with.
sub36_020_0007;What?! So it’s a bust?![~]Aww man, that’s no fun.
sub36_020_0008;Hey, chin up, Rikku.[~]Next time, huh? There are other caves.
sub36_020_0009;You’re right. Hopefully, they’ve got some fierce Mirages[~]protecting some [f2]awesome[/f] treasures, ’cause nothing else will cut it!
sub36_020_0010;Bingo. It’s too bad Ifrit wasn’t a vicious guardian.[~]Those [f2]always[/f] show up before the loot! You know how this stuff works.
sub36_020_0011;Yeah, and they gotta taunt! Something like[~]“I will knock you all down!” or whatever, before they run at you like a maniac!
sub36_020_0012;Kweh!
sub36_020_0013;But I’m in this for the long haul.[~]Somewhere out there, awesome treasure is waiting just for me!
sub36_020_0014;You said it, Rikku! That’s the spirit!
sub36_020_0015;Kweh!
sub36_020_0016;Trejjie-wejjie, trejjie-wejjie, la la la la la![~]Doo doo doo! Ba ba ba!
sub36_020_0016_1;(Leaves excitedly)
sub36_020_0016_2;(Leaves excitedly)
sub36_020_0016_3;(Leaves excitedly)
sub36_020_0017;No one’s ever handled Ifrit like that before...[~]Who [f2]are[/f] those two?
