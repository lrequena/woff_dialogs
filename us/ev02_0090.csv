ev02_0090_0000;Huh? What’s this thing?
ev02_0090_0001;Oh! I was hoping a path might link the-up here.
ev02_0090_0002;Hey! Tama!
ev02_0090_0003;W-wait up!
ev02_0090_0004;Huh?
ev02_0090_0005;Hm? We’re back in Nine Wood Hills?
ev02_0090_0006;You see, the Gate here doesn’t connect to just one the-area.
ev02_0090_0007;All throughout Grymoire you’ll find places—[~]safe the-locations that lead back here.[~]Open the way to come and the-go as you please!
ev02_0090_0008;And how exactly do we do that?
ev02_0090_0009;You already the-saw.[~]Just walk up to the right place,[~]and that’s all it the-takes.
ev02_0090_0010;But [f2]surely[/f] a means of transportation that handy[~]must come with a catch?
ev02_0090_0011;No the-catch![~]You can use the Gate as the-little[~]or much as you like.
ev02_0090_0012;What’s more, time in here and time in Grymoire—[~]they don’t both the-flow at the same speed.
ev02_0090_0013;So whatever crisis is going the-down,[~]you can put it on hold [~]and kick back here till you’re ready.
ev02_0090_0014;Wow! It’s like magic!
ev02_0090_0015;Yeah... Really irresponsible magic.
ev02_0090_0016;Just imagine. Revisiting any place we’ve been!
ev02_0090_0017;We’ll call it...the Super Port-A-Party!
ev02_0090_0018;Are you the-kidding?[~]That name definitely the-gets an F.
ev02_0090_0019;He deserves an H.
ev02_0090_0020;An H?! But grades only go down to F!
ev02_0090_0021;Extra, extra. Read aaall about it.
ev02_0090_0022;Wh-what do [f2]you[/f] the-want here, Serafie?
ev02_0090_0023;In case you’re wondering, you can use the Prism Case[~]anywhere you find one of these Gates.
ev02_0090_0024;Oh, I think I the-get it now. Gates are the-what you meant[~]when you talked about a “strong connection.”
ev02_0090_0025;Heh? Oh, right, right. That’s the gist of it.
ev02_0090_0026;Even inside dungeons...
ev02_0090_0027;don’t forget to pop open your Prism Case when you[~]{NewLine}get the change and reevaluate your lineup.
