sub13_030_0000;Hey! Guess who’s back!
sub13_030_0001;Listen, we were kind of hoping[~]you might lend us that Judgment Staff of yours.
sub13_030_0002;Ha ha ha! I knew it.[~]You two are here after all.
sub13_030_0003;Well, technically, it’s just Lightning.
sub13_030_0004;Alas though. If you are here for the staff, you are just a tad too late.[~]You see, I have already passed it on to my scion.
sub13_030_0005;“Sighing”? About what?
sub13_030_0006;It’s [f2]sci[/f]-on.[~]Should I pull out a dictionary, or are you in a hurry?
sub13_030_0007;Just do what I always do and pretend that he’s not even talking.[~]So, who has the staff now?
sub13_030_0008;My granddaughter.
sub13_030_0009;Your what?
sub13_030_0010;It’s true.[~]Oi! Sweetheart! Come say hello to our guests!
sub13_030_0011;Kaaay-aaay!
sub13_030_0012;Ra-mewwwl!
sub13_030_0013;Oh, come [f2]on[/f]. Listen now, grandpa.[~]I’m sure she’s a real sweetheart,[~]but shouldn’t she be out of diapers before you—
sub13_030_0014;Loser.
sub13_030_0015;Aaagggh!
sub13_030_0016;Sure [f2]you[/f] don’t need a diaper?
sub13_030_0017;Let me assure you,[~]my granddaughter is more than capable of wielding the staff.
sub13_030_0018;If you want it for yourselves,[~]you will just have to win it from her in combat.
