ev22_0050_0000;Drum roll please...[~]Ready to start the operation?
ev22_0050_0001;Fine then.
ev22_0050_0002;Come see me if you party poopers change your mind.
ev22_0050_0003;Huh? Oh! Good.[~]Then Operation Salvation is [f2]so[/f] on.
ev22_0050_0004;Oh, you don’t have to hunt down the summoners or the League of S.[~]I can get the word out.
ev22_0050_0005;Okay. It’s go time, Reynn.
ev22_0050_0006;Right.
ev22_0050_0007;The Ultima Gate?[~]What do they hope to achieve?
ev22_0050_0008;Hey!
ev22_0050_0009;Hm?
ev22_0050_0009_1;(SLASHING with his sword)
ev22_0050_0010;What are you doing?
ev22_0050_0011;Ha!
ev22_0050_0012;Ha!
ev22_0050_0013;Hmph.
ev22_0050_0014;For the win!
ev22_0050_0015;Hmph. The Champions have come.
ev22_0050_0016;You should not have been able to reach this castle.[~]Why would you come here?
ev22_0050_0017;Hurry to the Ultima Gate.[~]Our dear Champions seem to have devised some trick.
ev22_0050_0018;Hee hee ha ha ha![~]What trick could ever redeem these wretches now?
ev22_0050_0019;So we weren’t able to stop them.
ev22_0050_0020;That’s not our objective. We’re here to free the Architects’ souls.[~]The Ultima Gate—we’ll have to leave it to the twins.
ev22_0050_0021;Right.
ev22_0050_0022;This is not what I would call speedy.
ev22_0050_0023;They’re trying to reverse-summon all of the Cogna at once.[~]Give them some time.
ev22_0050_0024;Well—
ev22_0050_0025;What is all of this?
ev22_0050_0026;......! It can’t be!
ev22_0050_0027;Dad! No, don’t!
ev22_0050_0028;So, you have at last remembered who this used to be.
ev22_0050_0029;But it’s too late for you!
ev22_0050_0030;Dad, I’m sorry. I should’ve listened to you when I had the chance...[~]instead of acting like a stupid little brat.
ev22_0050_0031;Yeah... I don’t listen. I [f2]won’t[/f] listen![~]Not unless you snap out of it right now!
ev22_0050_0032;I’m so sorry, Mom.
ev22_0050_0033;Nnn...! Gnnh!
ev22_0050_0034;You know, all I ever wanted was to be like you.
ev22_0050_0035;You kept the world safe from Mirages.[~]And how they loved you for it.
ev22_0050_0036;Still, I could see how hard you worked all the time.[~]So I stepped up. Lann and I decided we would help.
ev22_0050_0037;Right? We’d handle Mirages so you wouldn’t have to.
ev22_0050_0038;I never thought I was hurting you by taking them away.[~]Without your strength, the world crumbled.
ev22_0050_0039;But I believed if I got strong—[~]just as strong as you—
ev22_0050_0040;I could make your life easier.[~]I just wanted you to be happy, Mom.
ev22_0050_0041;What a know-it-all... Some things don't change.[~]I still haven't learned.
ev22_0050_0042;Because if I have to...[~]I’ll hurt you again!
