sub12_010_0000;Another wave. Magna roaders, six o’clock, approaching at speed.[~]Distance: point-eight klicks.
sub12_010_0001;Vivi! Directly behind you! Eight hundred out!
sub12_010_0002;I’m on it!
sub12_010_0003;All targets down.[~]Not a direct hit this time, but the blast was enough.
sub12_010_0004;...We can’t keep doing this forever.
sub12_010_0005;If I may, sir. There must be a mobile command center—[~]a Cogna that tells the others what to do.[~]If we can locate that, and destroy it...
sub12_010_0006;Command center...[~]There [f2]is[/f] that Cogna we’ve been trying to pin down.
sub12_010_0007;But you’ve heard the same reports as I have.[~]Not even the Black Mages’ magic was able to put a dent in it.
sub12_010_0008;Even if we found it, how are we supposed to stop it?
sub12_010_0009;If only we could use machines—[~]fight fire with fire like Reynn and Lann did.
sub12_010_0010;Fight fire with fire...[~]I think I know someone who can help.
sub12_010_0011;What is it?[~]I heard that you wished to speak to me?
sub12_010_0012;Allow me to get directly to the point.
sub12_010_0013;That Magitek armor of yours—[~]can it damage the Cogna’s mobile command center?
sub12_010_0014;The one in the desert?[~]I suppose it might be possible...
sub12_010_0015;Edgar, you’re staring.
sub12_010_0016;Oh, my apologies.[~]I couldn’t help but be captivated by your beauty.
sub12_010_0017;Tell me, did it hurt when you fell from heaven?
sub12_010_0018;Again? Really?
sub12_010_0019;Hm?
sub12_010_0020;Oh, you’re playing hard to get, I see.
sub12_010_0021;Ugh... So back to the subject at hand.[~]Is it possible, or no?
sub12_010_0022;My Magitek armor—I summoned it just like a Mirage.[~]So I imagine it must be similar to the Cogna.
sub12_010_0023;If so, logically speaking,[~]it should be able to hold its own against them.
sub12_010_0024;But...I wasn’t myself when I used it.[~]Segwarides was controlling me...
sub12_010_0025;Say no more, I understand.[~]Forgive me for opening up old wounds like that, shame on me.
sub12_010_0026;NOT USED
sub12_010_0027;But then of course,[~]my lady is free to inflict a few wounds of her own, now that she has laid my heart bare.
sub12_010_0028;Okay, so, what do we do about the Cogna?[~]Should we get Reynn and Lann after all?
sub12_010_0029;Good question.
sub12_010_0030;Reynn... Lann...[~]Right, I never did get a chance to repay them.
sub12_010_0031;......
sub12_010_0032;But I can help them now.[~]All right. I’ll do it!
