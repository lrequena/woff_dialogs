Nigiyakashi_Examine_Book_01;Azure Prophecy, 14:2:2[~][~]When time begins its march anew, they shall return as visitors: Jiants from the Hills of a world not our own. Upon Grymoire, they will wreak two divergent futures: one that brings salvation, and the other, ruin—an enigma to confound even the highest mind.
Nigiyakashi_Examine_Book_02;Azure Prophecy, 14:6:1[~][~]Empowered by destiny, the Jiants from the Hills shall mark upon history a new epoch. This dawn shall portend the awakening of the Mediums: a reveille of souls. The haves and the have-nots shall see their fates manifested and their natures revealed.[~][~]And lo, it shall be Ragnarok again. An end that with the new Champions will begin. To whom will this bring salvation? To whom?
Nigiyakashi_Examine_Book_03;Azure Prophecy, 9:3:3[~][~]Demons they shall one day assuredly be called. Their might will be great: two powers wielded as one. The world will tremble before this dyad. And yet, will their handiwork be evil or good?[~][~]At the end of their grand epoch, they shall lay themselves prostrate and become the foundation of peace: a brief lie, an enduring hope...
Nigiyakashi_Examine_Book_04_01;Azure Prophecy, Occulta 1 (Revised & Abridged)[~][~]From oblivion, light and dark were born. Light begat beasts known as espers. The dark begat monsters, and humans who sought the light.
Nigiyakashi_Examine_Book_04_02;In the Extraverse, the world surrounding all worlds, live gods that feed solely on death and destruction. These gods—amalgams of being and nonbeing—cannot be reasoned with.[~][~]One world found a tear in the fabric, and exploited it to confine espers inside their human bodies. However, this tear also left them open to the Extraverse and its brutal gods.
Nigiyakashi_Examine_Book_05;Crimson Prophecy, IV:4[~][~]Flanked by Mirages, the chosen ones shall gain possession of four keys. From the Crystal Tower they shall mount the heavens, where god will grant them the gift of eternity.
Nigiyakashi_Examine_Book_06;"Crimson Prophecy, IV:6:1[~][~]The Key of Flames: from a valley of fire shall rise
Nigiyakashi_Examine_Book_07;Crimson Prophecy, II:2[~][~]The Demon Dyad shall appear in the world of Grymoire, and it shall plunge all the land into turmoil.[~][~]The calamity the Demon Dyad unleashes shall consume the world in an instant. Powerless to stop it, the world will soon spiral toward destruction and learn the true meaning of despair.
Nigiyakashi_Examine_Book_08_01;Crimson Prophecy, II:3[~][~]But do not fear. When the Demon Dyad visits its destruction upon the world, a light of peace the people can trust will rise up, quietly and unfailingly.[~][~]This woman will use her holy power to create a bridge to salvation and summon three Heralds from the realm of the gods.
Nigiyakashi_Examine_Book_08_02;The Demon Dyad shall be powerless against the Heralds’ might. Body and mind broken, it shall enter an eternal sleep in a faraway prison.
Nigiyakashi_Examine_Book_09_01;Lore: Wielders of the Power of Creation[~][~]Legends persist of “Architects,” people with godlike powers who lived in the former land of the Jiants and possessed the ability to create matter from nothing. Though their power was not without limit, the greatest Architects had remarkable skill and could even create their own worlds as they saw fit.
Nigiyakashi_Examine_Book_09_02;Today, none with such evocative talents are known to exist. Some theorize that the Architects met with ruin, while others discount the possibility that people with that kind of power could ever have been real at all.
Nigiyakashi_Examine_Book_09_03;However, what parent today does not lull their child to sleep with bedtime stories about the Architects and their grand creations? Many believe that the Bahamutian Federation named their advancement program after these legendary figures in hopes of cultivating fecund minds who would build Grymoire a better future.
