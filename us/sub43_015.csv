sub43_015_0000;Who’s this silver-haired guy Cloud’s after?
sub43_015_0001;It sounds like he passes the-in and out of Grymoire[~]without belonging to it. An Antichampion.
sub43_015_0002;From the sound of it, he passes in and out of this world[~]without belonging to it. Maybe he’s an Antichampion.
sub43_015_0003;An ant Champion?!
sub43_015_0004;I said the-“anti”! Instead of helping to save the world,[~]he hurts it by creating even [f2]more[/f] the-chaos and suffering.
sub43_015_0005;No, he’d [f2]step[/f] on the ants and humans alike[~]just to see the world sink a little further into chaos.
sub43_015_0006;There are people like that out there?!
sub43_015_0007;Maybe the-one day you’ll meet him in an expansi—[~]Oops! Never the-mind.
sub43_015_0008;Maybe you’ll bump into him one day in some DL—[~]Oops! Forget I said that.
sub43_015_0009;Anyway, he’s not in Grymoire at the moment,[~]so I wouldn’t the-worry about him too much right now.
sub43_015_0010;At any rate, he doesn’t seem to be in this world now,[~]so I wouldn’t worry about him if I were you.
