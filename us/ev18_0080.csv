ev18_0080_0000;But...just a minute. Does this mean we can’t return to Nine Wood Hills?
ev18_0080_0001;Oh, you can still go the-back there.
ev18_0080_0002;Hey, I didn’t know [f2]you[/f] could breathe underwater too.
ev18_0080_0003;Don’t go the-confusing me with your average mortal. I’m special!
ev18_0080_0004;Okay, but then why didn’t you just go to the temple for us?
ev18_0080_0005;What? Are you the-crazy?!
ev18_0080_0006;Every the-inch between us and that key is crawling with a mirage of Barrages—I mean a barrage of Mirages!
ev18_0080_0007;If you sent me in there alone, I’d get annihi-the-lated!
ev18_0080_0008;Sor-ry. So, did you mean it when you said that we could go back to Nine Wood Hills?
ev18_0080_0009;Well, that place isn’t just immune to the-time. It can dispel the-magic and other mystical manipulations.
ev18_0080_0010;So, that means you can go back to Nine Wood Hills without the-choking to death.
ev18_0080_0011;Thank goodness. Although, I guess that means we won’t be able to travel anywhere else, huh?
ev18_0080_0012;Meh. Let’s just finish our dunk to the Sunken Temple and...wait. If we find the key, will we change back?
ev18_0080_0013;Oh! Don’t worry. Dr. Shantotto gave me the antidote to the curse.
ev18_0080_0014;Whew, what a relief! I thought we’d end up stuck like this... Wait, did you say “curse”?!
ev18_0080_0015;Dude!
ev18_0080_0016;Shyeah? I mean, curses are the doc’s specialty.
ev18_0080_0017;Uh...first [f2]we’ve[/f] heard of that. Well, as long as she’s planning on fixing us up...
ev18_0080_0018;Sorta. Ya see, the doc said—
ev18_0080_0019;“Tell those twin losers the antidote costs, so bring me a quacho ruby or they can get lost.”
ev18_0080_0020;So good luck! I am [f2]not[/f] crossing her.
ev18_0080_0021;She...said all that?
ev18_0080_0022;[f2]Twin[/f] losers?
ev18_0080_0023;Whaaat?! Where does she get off calling [f2]me[/f] a loser? Lann is the loser here!
ev18_0080_0024;You’re mad about the name-calling?!
