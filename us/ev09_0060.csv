ev09_0060_0000;Huh, looks like even Mirages[~]have to put up with mean old bullies.
ev09_0060_0000_1;Hrrg... Hup.
ev09_0060_0001;Take care!
ev09_0060_0002;Reynn, c’mon!
ev09_0060_0003;Huh? What?
ev09_0060_0004;We’re Mirage Keepers![~]If you’re gonna let ’em just swim away, then—
ev09_0060_0005;Then you are...you’re...doing exactly the right thing!
ev09_0060_0006;——————————!
ev09_0060_0007;Meeewww!
ev09_0060_0008;Hmm?
ev09_0060_0009;Young Mirage Keepers.[~]My minimantoise here tells me[~]that you saved his life. I thank you.
ev09_0060_0010;——————————!
ev09_0060_0011;It...it talked! With words!
ev09_0060_0012;Hwooow... A talking the-Mirage!
ev09_0060_0013;Seriously?
ev09_0060_0014;Now, tell me what a pair of Keepers like you[~]are doing all the way out here?
ev09_0060_0015;Uh, well...
ev09_0060_0016;Hmm... Then, I shall help you find this “Babil.”[~]You are free to ride on my back.
ev09_0060_0017;Dude!
ev09_0060_0018;Are you sure?
ev09_0060_0019;Ohhh yes. I’ll be your “fastcraft.”[~]Or my best approximation of what a fastcraft is.
