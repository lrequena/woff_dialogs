sub15_010_0000;Cid, have you found a pattern yet?[~]Where’s the Phantom Train?
sub15_010_0001;Hmm, still no luck, I fear.[~]It gives new meaning to “random,” I can tell you that much.
sub15_010_0002;Ugh...[~]Well, if you can’t track it, we’ll have to give up for now.
sub15_010_0003;A train that traverses the real and unreal...[~]Just our luck.
sub15_010_0004;And it only shows itself when it’s ready to attack.[~]Not an honorable Mirage, is it?
sub15_010_0005;If only we had documentation of how these Mirage trains work—[~]even just some blueprints would do.
sub15_010_0006;That’s it!
sub15_010_0007;That’s what, Reynn?
sub15_010_0008;We already know someone who runs a Mirage train!
sub15_010_0009;Umm...[~]Oh, cactus guy!
sub15_010_0010;That’s right.[~]The time to exact my revenge has finally arrived.
sub15_010_0011;Cactuar![~]Your sass...is grass!
sub15_010_0012;Hah! You certainly are fired up today now, aren’t you?[~]My little Jiant girl!
sub15_010_0013;Um, Reynn?[~]I know you’re excited about this, but can I cut in?
sub15_010_0014;Sure. Be my guest.
sub15_010_0015;Conductor, if my sister beats you,[~]how ’bout you promise to give us the blueprints to your train. Deal?
sub15_010_0016;Oh, we’re on.[~]But that’s a big “if” you’re talking about!
sub15_010_0017;I...I can’t the-believe Lann is the calmest person in the room!
sub15_010_0018;This has to the-be a sign of the end-times![~]We’re all the-doomed!
sub15_010_0019;Hey!
sub15_010_0020;Here I come!
sub15_010_0021;Ha! Bring it!
