ev09_0020_0000;Okay, so like, all we gotta do is cross the Low Seas[~]and find that valley of fire.
ev09_0020_0001;Well...
ev09_0020_0002;[f2]I don’t know... Are we really just gonna[~]follow some random prophecy word for word?[/f]
ev09_0020_0003;[f2]But, what other leads do we have?[/f]
ev09_0020_0004;Fine. I guess we’ll run with it.
ev09_0020_0005;Huh? What?
ev09_0020_0006;Captain Faris, can you tell us[~]how to get to the Low Seas?
ev09_0020_0007;Hmm... Perhaps.[~]But I’ll not be lending you [f2]this[/f] ship.
ev09_0020_0008;For one, she can’t venture downsea,[~]even if I [f2]were[/f] feeling generous.
ev09_0020_0009;Ah. Wait. Ahoy, Mog![~]Is our guest still aboard?
ev09_0020_0010;Guest, kupo?
ev09_0020_0011;You know who. Oi.[~]The lass in glasses.
ev09_0020_0012;Oh, from the League, kupo![~]She might be, kupo. I’ll go look, kupo.
ev09_0020_0013;You need something?
ev09_0020_0014;Sorry to detain you.
ev09_0020_0015;I thought we were done with our transaction.[~]Did you find some sort of problem with the cargo?
ev09_0020_0016;No, the goods were sound.[~]I’ve another quandary...if you’ll hear me out.
ev09_0020_0017;What’s that?
ev09_0020_0018;These gents here have business in the Low Seas.
ev09_0020_0019;Who are they?
ev09_0020_0020;The Jiants from the Hills. In the flesh.
ev09_0020_0021;What?!
ev09_0020_0022;Ta-daaah!
ev09_0020_0023;Cut that [f2]out![/f]
ev09_0020_0024;Ow!
ev09_0020_0025;Sorry ’bout Lann. I guess we [f2]might[/f] be the Jiants[~]from the prophecy, but honestly? We don’t know.
ev09_0020_0026;Very intriguing.
ev09_0020_0027;So, they need a boat.[~]And as I recall, you’ve got one.
ev09_0020_0028;Well...if it’s true about the thane—[~]that he’s some kind of monstrous[~]Bahamutian doppelgänger—
ev09_0020_0029;then we don’t owe him anything.[~]Which means...that the boat is up for grabs.
ev09_0020_0030;Aye.
ev09_0020_0031;Wait, “up for grabs”?[~]What do you mean?
ev09_0020_0032;Oh, my group had some business to attend to in Saronia,[~]so we presented the thane with a boat.
ev09_0020_0033;Some might call it a...a bribe.
ev09_0020_0034;You don’t need to wheel and the-deal[~]with a bunch of no-good monsters like that.
ev09_0020_0035;Yeah!
ev09_0020_0036;You’re not even listening.
ev09_0020_0037;Yeah!
ev09_0020_0038;So you’re absolutely certain?[~]You saw the thane undergo a transformation?
ev09_0020_0039;Aye, and then Syldra let him have it!
ev09_0020_0040;Okay. Well, don’t get me wrong.[~]I can see that they’re Jiants...
ev09_0020_0041;But I can also see they’ve got some growing up to do.[~]Do you think they’ll survive the trip?
ev09_0020_0042;Ha. One splash in the Low Seas can’t stop a prophecy.
ev09_0020_0043;...Well, I guess you win.[~]You can take the fastcraft down to the Low Seas.
ev09_0020_0044;Oh, sweet!
ev09_0020_0045;Thank you so much!
ev09_0020_0046;[f2]Although, that whispering wasn’t very encouraging...[/f]
