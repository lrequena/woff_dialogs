ev20_0040_0000;Well, I know that you two have been through a lot recently but...why don’t we start out by sharing our intel?
ev20_0040_0001;Everyone’s on deck, except the injured.
ev20_0040_0002;This way.
ev20_0040_0003;Oh, yeah![~]Do you know how Hauyn is doing?
ev20_0040_0004;She’s sound asleep,[~]down in the infirmary.
ev20_0040_0005;I talked to Dr. Kadowaki.[~]Her diagnosis is that Hauyn is suffering from severe exhaustion.
ev20_0040_0006;That’s...too bad...
ev20_0040_0007;What about Yuna, and the summoners?
ev20_0040_0008;Same thing. They were forced to use their powers against their will.[~]It took a lot out of them.
ev20_0040_0009;Same goes for Tidus.[~]He won’t wake up.
ev20_0040_0010;Tidus...[~]Is he okay?
ev20_0040_0011;He took a beating, but they say he’s gonna pull through.[~]You know, he’s pretty tough for a scrawny guy.
ev20_0040_0012;In fact, Tidus might be the only reason we were able[~]to get to the summoners in time. You know that winged knight?
ev20_0040_0013;I found Tidus fighting her.[~]He told me about the summoners, so we went to go save them.
ev20_0040_0014;Right. And once me and Squall got word—
ev20_0040_0015;You all showed up to bail us out, huh?[~]It’s a really good thing you did.
ev20_0040_0016;Now you can help us fill in the blanks.[~]Bahamut—did you figure out who they really are?
ev20_0040_0016_1;Huh?
ev20_0040_0017;And those weird Mirages he called “Cogna”?
ev20_0040_0018;What did you two kids do back there?
ev20_0040_0019;Oh! Uh, it’s funny you should ask...
ev20_0040_0020;We don’t know what happened either.[~]But what little we do know, we’ll tell you.
ev20_0040_0021;Wow... Then I guess the only one with answers[~]is your sister Hauyn.
ev20_0040_0022;Excuse the interruption.[~]I have new intel from our liaisons across Grymoire.
ev20_0040_0023;Oh!
ev20_0040_0024;Shelke.
ev20_0040_0025;What’s the story?
ev20_0040_0026;You should have a look at this.
ev20_0040_0027;What...happened?
ev20_0040_0028;Well, those new Mirages called Cogna have been taking over[~]wherever they show up. For the most part, at least.
ev20_0040_0029;For the most part?[~]What do you mean?
ev20_0040_0030;Our reports say that towns belonging to the Federation[~]were assimilated right away.
ev20_0040_0031;But the places that have been resisting Federation rule
ev20_0040_0032;have managed to keep the Cogna out so far.
ev20_0040_0033;However, other threats have arisen.
ev20_0040_0034;What?
ev20_0040_0035;There have also been multiple sightings of the Dyad’s Servants.
ev20_0040_0036;Sorry, who are the “Dyad’s Servants”?
ev20_0040_0037;A century ago,[~]the Demon Dyad plunged Grymoire into an era of chaos.
ev20_0040_0038;The Dyad’s Servants were Mirages[~]that carried out most of the Dyad’s dirty work. Right?
ev20_0040_0039;......
ev20_0040_0040;So you’re saying[~]the Servants are back after a hundred years?
ev20_0040_0041;That appears to be the case.
ev20_0040_0042;The Cogna have given them a chance[~]to begin their reign of terror all over again.
ev20_0040_0043;Hey, Lann.[~]I think that we saw them.
ev20_0040_0044;One came out of the crater where we fought the bomb.[~]Another flew out from underneath Figaro Castle.
ev20_0040_0045;Huh? Wh-what exactly are you getting at?[~]Are you saying we caused that too?
ev20_0040_0046;We might have set them loose by accident.
ev20_0040_0047;Dude, no...
ev20_0040_0048;I’ll say this.[~]We need to take action now.
ev20_0040_0049;The League will get to work with our agents on the ground.
ev20_0040_0050;At any rate, it might be a while before Hauyn wakes up.[~]Why don’t you guys get some rest.
ev20_0040_0051;If she’s really your sister,[~]make sure you talk things out.
