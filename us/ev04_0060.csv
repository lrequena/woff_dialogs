ev04_0060_0000;Huh?
ev04_0060_0001;The princess? Dude, she [f2]is[/f] here!
ev04_0060_0002;Heh heh... I guess she’s the hands-on type.
ev04_0060_0003;Ah!
ev04_0060_0004;Your Highness! Behind you!
ev04_0060_0005;Huh?
ev04_0060_0006;Look out!
ev04_0060_0007;Aaah!
ev04_0060_0008;Hyah!
ev04_0060_0009;Are you all right, Highness?
ev04_0060_0010;Uh, yes, thank you.
ev04_0060_0011;Oh shmup! We gotta find a way down there, now!
ev04_0060_0012;We can go around. If we’re fast enough, we—
ev04_0060_0013;No! There’s no time!
ev04_0060_0014;Princess!
ev04_0060_0015;No!
ev04_0060_0016;Princess Sarah! You okay?
ev04_0060_0017;Dude, that move was awesome!
ev04_0060_0018;I...I don’t know what just happened.
ev04_0060_0019;I think I do. That light would explain it.
ev04_0060_0020;Good captain, from this day on,[~]you shall be called the Warrior of Light.
ev04_0060_0021;Me? Are you sure?
ev04_0060_0022;Yes. The legends of Cornelia tell of others like you.
ev04_0060_0023;Nameless heroes with great power in their hearts:[~]Warriors of Light.
ev04_0060_0024;You are a Medium.[~]One with the potential[~]to become this realm’s Champion.
ev04_0060_0025;Wait, a Medium? ...A Champion?
ev04_0060_0026;Champions arise at critical points in time,[~]where they awaken unexpectedly[~]to their miraculous power.
ev04_0060_0027;Candidates who hide this light within them—[~]this strength—we call them Mediums.
ev04_0060_0028;The Warriors of Light, of course,[~]are unique to Cornelian legend, but...
ev04_0060_0029;Mediums for other Champions[~]can still be found throughout Grymoire to this day.
ev04_0060_0030;Incredible. So I’m really one of them?
ev04_0060_0031;Yes. There is no mistake.
ev04_0060_0032;I think...the light Lann and Reynn sent me was a sort of reveille.[~]Like I’d been sleeping my whole life and finally...woke up.
ev04_0060_0033;...Do you have that power?[~]Do you have the ability to awaken Mediums as Champions?
ev04_0060_0034;Hmm...
ev04_0060_0035;I wish we knew. Like I said,[~]we don’t remember all that much about who we are.
ev04_0060_0036;Wait, hold on.
ev04_0060_0000a;ANIMATION (Priority A): Starts here[~]Birth of a Champion
ev04_0060_0000b;ANIMATION (Priority A): Ends here
