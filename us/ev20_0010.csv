ev20_0010_0001;Is that...Mom?
ev20_0010_0001_1;......!
ev20_0010_0002;Are you the one who summoned me?
ev20_0010_0003;......!!
ev20_0010_0004;Lann?
ev20_0010_0005;Are you okay?

ev20_0010_0008;Are you the king?[~]Of the Bahamutian Federation?!
ev20_0010_0009;Federation? How very quaint.[~]Is that the tale Segwarides has been spreading?

ev20_0010_0011;He’s the one.[~]The villain behind it all.
ev20_0010_0012;In the cage there—is that Lusse Farna?[~]What did you do to our mom?
ev20_0010_0013;Is that why you have come?
ev20_0010_0014;What?
ev20_0010_0015;Tell me why you have traveled all this way.
ev20_0010_0016;You have our mom, right?[~]Give her back!
ev20_0010_0017;Yeah. Start by setting her free.
ev20_0010_0018;Yeah!

ev20_0010_0020;Huh?
ev20_0010_0021;Still.
