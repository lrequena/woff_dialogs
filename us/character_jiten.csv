CHARACTER_JITEN_01_1;[#ff368c79]Age in Nine Wood Hills:[/#] 15[~][~][#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] Markings on his left arm / “Dude!” / Reynn’s younger twin brother / Mentally incontinent, but morally regular / Considers proper word usage to be optional[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_01_2;[#ff368c79]Personality[/#][~]While Lann may seem like a dummy, he has a good heart, a strong sense of responsibility, and he always puts his family first. Note that he steps out in front of his sister when danger approaches, almost automatically, which would imply he holds her life more dear than his own.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_01_3;[#ff368c79]Memories from 100 Years Ago[/#][~]If they had merely forgotten their past, Lann and Reynn might have been able to remember it again, but those memories were literally “lost” and cannot be retrieved. Thus, anything the twins [f2]have[/f] been “remembering” must [f2]not[/f] have been lost.[~][~]What did Tama mean when she said Lann and Reynn could have “ruled the world”? How did they meet the Pleiad? If there used to be more Mirage Keepers, then just imagine how many Mirages there were. Perhaps brother and sister used to be acquainted with other Champions, from that other time. But we can no longer relive those stories with Lann and Reynn. At least, not from where they are standing now...[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_01_4;[#ff368c79]Lann’s Future[/#][~]Through their exploits in Grymoire, Lann and Reynn have proven their worth and been elevated to the pantheon of Champions. These heroes serve the A-Worlds, the Realms of Fantasy under Alexander’s dominion. And so we may meet the twins again: in one of these worlds, or perhaps more.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_02_2;[#ff368c79]Under Enna Kros’s Watchful Eye[/#][~]Enna Kros said that she “checked up” on Reynn and Lann during their slumber in Nine Wood Hills, but why? Did she feel some sort of strong attachment to them?[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_02_3;[#ff368c79]Hand-Picked[/#][~]Despite her significant physical and emotional strength, Reynn is not invincible. She is particularly easy to wound, it seems, when it comes to family, as you may have noted after she experienced the loss of her brother. However, Reynn rose above that moment of weakness and pushed onward, no matter how much it hurt—and this is exactly the kind of fortitude Enna Kros was banking on.[~][~]Enna Kros hand-picked Reynn and Lann, in fact, from among all the denizens of all the Realms of Fantasy. Perhaps she has other favorites we can meet in another tale.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_02_4;[#ff368c79]Reynn’s Future[/#][~]The Reynn and Lann that were bestowed upon Hauyn as prismariums are, as it turns out, newly born Champions. But what of the Lann and Reynn who were sucked through the gate? That is a story for another time.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_03_VOICEACTOR;CV: Cassandra Morris / Kana Hanazawa
CHARACTER_JITEN_03_ORIGINAL;First World of Origin:[~][f2]WORLD OF FINAL FANTASY [/f](Apocrypha)[~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_03_1;[#ff368c79]Supposed Age:[/#] 24[~](And never a day older, says she)[~][~][#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] Surprisingly casual / Seems kind of hands-off / Old friend of Tama and Serafie / Sincere, and never known to lie / Drops dire truths with a smile, making it hard to tell when to be worried[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_03_2;[#ff368c79]She’s God[/#][~]No, really, she is. While some regard her as a funny lady with a divinity complex, she is in fact the real actual creator of Grymoire and other “Realms of Fantasy.” She calls the shots and makes the rules, although she (usually) prefers not to interfere once they’re in place.[~][~]Basically, gods never make mistakes, and so if humanity is a divine creation, then all possible deeds of humankind must fall within divine parameters and therefore be error-free, right? And since humanity is error-free, why should god have to work? Her nine-to-five shift ended when she created people. Such are the reckless musings of Enna Kros, Lazy God.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_03_3;[#ff368c79]The Realms of Fantasy[/#][~]When building her worlds, Enna Kros took glimpses at many other worlds outside her dominion, cherry-picked the elements she liked, and integrated these “figments” into her creations. Her Champion System derives from this mechanic.[~][~]Since before using the power of fantasy to create worlds, Enna Kros has maintained a close friendship with The Girl Who Forgot Her Name, whom she found by chance at the source of that power.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_03_4;[#ff368c79]The Champion System[/#][~]At the core of Enna Kros’s fantasy worlds lies a crystal, which The Girl Who Forgot Her Name refers to as the Deus Crystal. Conceived by dreams, the crystal can take flights of fancy to distant worlds that have no logical connection to its own. Enna Kros (better known as Alexander) sifts through the figments the crystal finds in search of souls with the potential to protect her worlds from threats like the Exnine Knights and the Cogna. She then shapes these souls into Crystal Cubes, which become a descendible, self-sufficient system of antibodies that activates when her universe is threatened from the outside.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_03_5;[#ff368c79]Alexander as Enna Kros[/#][~]The woman “Enna Kros” is not the god Alexander’s true divine form, but rather that of a soldier named Roksanne who existed prior to the creation of the Realms of Fantasy. Alexander was fond of Roksanne’s spirit and chose to merge with her soul rather than absorb it. (Incidentally, Roksanne once summoned Tama and had a pact with her.)[~][~]Of course, a god’s mind is vast and requires many faces. While life as Roksanne provides much enjoyment, Alexander also frequently appears as a male: a fierce young man named Aris. (This young man was once Serafie’s master.) So you see, outside of Grymoire, depending on which A-World you pay a visit to, you might find that god has more forms than one.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_04_ORIGINAL;First World of Origin:[~][f2]WORLD OF FINAL FANTASY [/f](Apocrypha)[~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_04_1;[#ff368c79]Age:[/#] Immeasurable[~](Due to her alternate interpretation of time)[~][~][#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] Navigator / Talks the-funny / Floats / Rides on people’s heads / A little girl at heart / Knows how to run with a joke / Pure and innocent[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_04_2;[#ff368c79]Sphere of Influence[/#][~]Tama maintains an extremely high number of thresholds, and commands a large repertory of talents. However, depending on the world she visits, she must limit her talents to a smaller subset. For example, in Grymoire, Tama can help Lann and Reynn out by negating their deaths or other failures (through microreversals of time) or control space (as with Gate travel). She is required to pay for these actions in lives (or souls), but all the same her powers rival that of a god’s. No wonder she’s prevented from using them all at once.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_04_3;[#ff368c79]Relationship with Enna Kros[/#][~]Tama has known Enna Kros since before she became a god. She possesses far vaster powers than her small stature suggests.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_04_4;"[#ff368c79]Tamamohimé[/#][~]This is just one wondrous, intense manifestation of the hidden power Tama has accrued during her lengthy existence. Tamamohimé can recover all nine of her lives in less than a day. By borrowing The Girl Who Forgot Her Name’s power over time and fantasy, she can produce with ease miracles far beyond her normal capabilities. And because all of her lives are restored to her each day, she can sacrifice them with near impunity. Calling her some kind of super-hacker wouldn’t be off base
CHARACTER_JITEN_05_VOICEACTOR;CV: Nancy Sullivan / Eri Kitamura
CHARACTER_JITEN_05_ORIGINAL;First World of Origin:[~][f2]WORLD OF FINAL FANTASY [/f](Apocrypha)[~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_05_1;[#ff368c79]Age:[/#] Immeasurable[~][~][#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] Undetectably excited / Refuses to enthuse / Supposedly everyone’s favorite pixie / Flies / Watering can / “How did [f2]that [/f]get there?” / Keeps cards close to her chest[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_05_2;[#ff368c79]Longtime Friends[/#][~]Beneath that laid-back drawl is...well, a really laid-back pixie. Like Tama, Serafie and Enna Kros go way, way back, to before Enna Kros became a god. Consequently, she and Tama have just as long a history.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_05_3;[#ff368c79]Rumor Radar[/#][~]Using her special powers, Serafie can gather up gossip of all kinds: near and far, old and new, silly and serious. Don’t let your definition of “rumor” cloud you, though. If someone has said it, even whispered it at some point, Serafie can [f2]reach through time[/f] to yoink (as she might say) that nugget of hearsay into the present. That’s power to get excited about, even if [f2]she[/f] doesn’t show it.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_05_4;[#ff368c79]Nothing to Sniff At[/#][~]Serafie has an eidetic memory, and her wealth of knowledge comprises things she has heard in myriad worlds throughout the ages. One could argue there is nothing she [f2]doesn’t[/f] know. While she has been known to work incredible miracles with this knowledge, she seems to have largely ceased using it, perhaps to shield her mind from such abnormal quantities of information. She limits herself to perfunctory cognitive tasks, and dusts off her data banks in only the rarest of situations. If it seems like she’s just floating through life, that’s why. So the good news is, she can answer any question. The bad news is that you might die waiting.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_06_2;[#ff368c79]Bad Blood[/#][~]Hauyn appears to have some kind of deep-seated grudge against Lann and Reynn. But if they are truly family, then what could have happened?[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_06_3;[#ff368c79]Family[/#][~]Hauyn is not a lineal descendant of the Farna bloodline, nor is she Lann and Reynn’s sister by blood. However, she was taken in and raised by their mother, Lusse, and became family to them all the same.[~][~]Hauyn bears an atavistic resemblance to her siblings because she, too, is descended from the first Farna, and comes from a distant but hereditarily strong branch of the family. Her age, seventeen, does not factor in the years she spent trapped in the cage, outside of time.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_06_4;"[#ff368c79]Architects and Breakers[/#][~]You may recall Hauyn speaking to Lann and Reynn about their unique powers. Lann seems to have largely inherited their father’s “Architect” powers, while Reynn has inherited their mother’s “Breaker” powers. However, that is not to say their powers were evenly split
CHARACTER_JITEN_06_5;"[#ff368c79]A Tragic Figure[/#][~]Hauyn used to be full of kindness...but that was before Lann locked her in a cage for a hundred years. One can hardly blame her for hating the twins for all the harm they have done. However, the type of cage Hauyn was trapped in is like a prismarium

CHARACTER_JITEN_07_2;[#ff368c79]Ywain[/#][~]The woman in the mask was an illusion created by a carbuncle whom Brandelis called “Ywain.” In other words, the carbuncle was the one leading around the woman, not the other way around.[~][~]Ywain’s skill lies in creating such illusions and impressing upon beholders’ minds that they are real. By setting a lavish stage—a beautiful lie—he was able to convince Lann and Reynn to restore the Ultima Gate without reminding them of what had happened there before.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_07_3;"[#ff368c79]Ywain’s Role[/#][~]Ywain was tasked with using the cage’s power to seize control of Hauyn’s ability as a summoner and increase the number of Mirages in Grymoire—to bring order to the world through disorder. It seems likely he assumed Hauyn’s form to use her powers more effectively
CHARACTER_JITEN_07_4;"[#ff368c79]The Unlucky Carbuncle[/#][~]Just as Brandelis transferred Pellinore and Segwarides into human vessels, he transferred a third Exnine Knight into the carbuncle that was accompanying Hauyn.[~][~]However, any carbuncle would have been a poor choice of vessel, and this one was weak
CHARACTER_JITEN_07_5;[#ff368c79]The Exnine Knights[/#][~]Each of the Exnine Knights is a fusion of three things: a human, an esper, and a cyborg.[~]- The humans were knights who lived in Roksanne’s era.[~]- The espers, all powerful ones, were forcibly summoned by the knights from their respective worlds.[~]- The cyborgs were used as relics in the summoning.[~]Combined, they became beings of unfathomable power. Those among them with a common purpose founded the Exnine Knights.[~][~]What purpose? Well, the cyborgs’ goal is to bring about the end of fully organic life. And both the humans and espers who make up the Exnine Knights have their reasons for hating Alexander and Enna Kros... You can piece the rest together.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_08_1;[#ff368c79]Age:[/#] Immeasurable[~][~][#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] Black armor / Horns / Six wings cloaking his body[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_08_2;[#ff368c79]Soul Beneath the Armor:[/#][~]Bahamut Brandelis[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_08_3;[#ff368c79]King of Bahamut[/#][~]The “king of Bahamut” is not Brandelis’s own styling, nor does he consider himself the ruler of any “federation.” These names were adopted by Segwarides to lend an imposing air to their growing army.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_08_4;[#ff368c79]Sphere of Influence[/#][~]Because Brandelis is actually present in Grymoire, he is able to create a threshold of his own, within which he can apply the rules of his own worlds. These rules allow him, for example, to possess human vessels with his allies, and he was able to transform Lann’s Ultima Gate so it unleashed hordes of Cogna upon Grymoire.[~][~]Furthermore, his threshold has the power to override the most fundamental rules of Grymoire or any other A-World (as he calls worlds created by the god Alexander), rendering him virtually immortal.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_08_5;[#ff368c79]A Past Century, A Century’s Passing[/#][~]Perhaps one of our story’s greatest mysteries is this: what exactly was Brandelis doing in Grymoire during the hundred years of Reynn and Lann’s slumber? The answer, as it turns out, is “nothing.” Brandelis did not know Segwarides was building the Bahamutian Army, because he was imprisoned. Lusse and Rorrik used the last of their strength to trap him, locking him between the Ultima Gate and the great door of light. The door’s four keys were hidden across Grymoire along with four of the Pleiad, the world’s mightiest espers.[~][~]However, keys that lock can also unlock, and in time their powerful magic would draw Lann and Reynn through the gauntlet of Mirages guarding them. They found the keys, just as Segwarides “prophesied,” and finally removed the one barrier holding Brandelis in place.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_08_6;"[#ff368c79]The Exnine Knights[/#][~]Sometimes written as “Ex9.” An order of knights with godlike power. They despise everything about Alexander, creator of the Realms of Fantasy, and seek to bring about the destruction of all of Alexander’s work. Enna Kros is aware of twenty-seven members, but many of their abilities and identities remain shrouded in mystery.[~][~]Each member of the Exnine Knights has a numeric designation

CHARACTER_JITEN_09_1;[#ff368c79]Age:[/#] Immeasurable[~][~][#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] Winged armor / Claws / Female / Has full command of the skies[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_09_2;[#ff368c79]Soul Beneath the Armor:[/#][~]Valigarmanda Pellinore[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_09_3;"[#ff368c79]An Unstable Copy[/#][~]At Brandelis’s behest, Pellinore copied herself into the body of a human in order to enter Grymoire. However, this method of entry allowed her to reproduce only a mere fraction of her powers. What’s more, Lusse’s tremendously strong will continues to vie for control of her body
CHARACTER_JITEN_09_4;[#ff368c79]Ultimate Forms[/#][~]Pellinore and Segwarides have ultimate forms, similar to the final form that Brandelis assumed. However, because of their nebulous existence in Grymoire, they cannot perform these sorts of transformations. Still, their originals remain unscathed and unaffected by the outcome of this story, so perhaps there are more of Pellinore and Segwarides out there, terrorizing other worlds in their true forms.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_09_5;[#ff368c79]Pecking Order[/#][~]Pellinore’s numeric designation in the Exnine Knights is Ex9-III-4. While the knights have no defined hierarchy, and no single one of them can technically lord over another, Brandelis rose to a natural position of leadership in Grymoire because he was able to wield the greatest amount of power therein.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_10_1;[#ff368c79]Age:[/#] Immeasurable[~][~][#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] Masklike face / No discernable torso / Hints of iambic pentameter / Creepy laugh[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_10_3;[#ff368c79]Brains, Not Brawn[/#][~]Like Pellinore, Segwarides copied himself into the body of a human in order to join Brandelis in Grymoire. And just like with Pellinore, he was unable to take the full extent of his power along for the ride. However, Segwarides [f2]was[/f] able to bring his most formidable weapon—his devious mind—and has been able to draw from it without restraint, even in Grymoire.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_10_4;[#ff368c79]On Stealing a Body[/#][~]Despite leaving their powers behind, Segwarides and Pellinore also gained powers upon entering Grymoire: namely, the powers of their human hosts. The so-called Bahamutian Federation’s hold on the bulk of Grymoire’s Mirages can largely be attributed to Lusse and Rorrik’s abilities. However, because of Pellinore’s continued failure to fully subjugate Lusse, her command of Lusse’s powers remains inconsistent. Lann and Reynn have been far more successful at stealing Mirages back from the Bahamutian Army.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_10_5;"[#ff368c79]Destiny Control[/#][~]Segwarides’ numeric designation in the Exnine Knights is Ex9-I-3. One of his talents is “destiny control,” the ability to direct the course of history through prophecies. By scripting the future he seeks and letting others believe they are destined to make it happen, he can guide the world toward a preestablished harmony. However, he cannot simply tell people what to do

CHARACTER_JITEN_11_2;"[#ff368c79]Soul Beneath the Armor:[/#][~]Unknown
CHARACTER_JITEN_11_3;[#ff368c79]Sentient Soldier[/#][~]Refia’s uncle Takka was merely the guise for a Bahamutian soldier—but not just any soldier. Unlike the other Bahamutian grunts Lann and Reynn have encountered, this one is capable of thought, speech, and self-determination. No wonder Segwarides entrusted him with an entire nation in the Federation.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_11_4;[#ff368c79]Who Is He?[/#][~]Refia’s uncle Takka perished when his body was seized by the Bahamutian soldier. Consider for a moment the similarities to how Reynn and Lann’s parents were taken over, and the picture becomes a little clearer.[~][~]Segwarides summoned him to Grymoire, but he is not an Exnine Knight. Who, then? What you can take away is this: there may be many entities out there who, while unable to become Exnine Knights themselves, fight alongside them all the same. How fascinating that a [f2]manipulator[/f] of destiny like Segwarides summoned someone who [f2]obsesses[/f] over destiny in order to [f2]change[/f] destiny.[~][~]In the end, however, destiny had its own plan: that the thief who stole Takka’s body face the consequences, and be undone by Takka’s own nemesis.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_12_1;[#ff368c79]Age:[/#] 44[~](In flashbacks)[~][~][#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] Reynn and Lann’s mother / Queen of the Keepers / Sigils on both arms / Divine miracles / Kind mother / “Turn those corners up”[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_12_2;[#ff368c79]Lusse Farna’s Past[/#][~]A Jiant Queen who used to rule over the original Nine Wood Hills. She possessed extraordinary power, even compared to generations of Farnas. The divine sigils on both her arms (of which Lann and Reynn inherited one each) marked her as a worker of divine miracles. Before and after acceding to the throne at a young age, she produced countless wonders, such that history still remembers her as the Sovereign of Miracles.[~][~]One of Lusse Farna’s greatest achievements was to create, with the help of her future husband, Rorrik, a special crystal knife capable of subduing Mirages. These knives, which came to be known as “widgets,” brought Grymoire’s Mirages under Farna control and kept them from terrorizing the people.[~][~]Lusse was a good queen, full of integrity and dignity, and one who put down her foot when needed. But when it came to her own children, she was the same as many mothers: full of love, and sometimes too lenient. We know now that more discipline was called for, as the twins’ abuse of the power they gained had terrible repercussions for the world to come.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_12_3;"[#ff368c79]The Power of Breakers[/#][~]One of Lusse’s abilities was that of a “Breaker.” This godlike power allowed her to subvert the world’s rules—literally break them—and perform seemingly impossible feats. One of these feats was containing Lann and Reynn’s home, Nine Wood Hills, in its own private world, and splicing that world out of Grymoire.[~][~]Breaker power manifests itself most visibly in the arms, transforming them into superhuman shapes. This phenomenon can be traced back to Enna Kros—or more specifically, the royal line of Alexander. It is tricky to hide and control, especially for humans that Alexander has passed it on to. Even the great Enna Kros finds her right arm willfully transforming into Alexander’s when she least expects it

CHARACTER_JITEN_13_2;[#ff368c79]Rorrik’s Past[/#][~]An unsung source of support to Lusse Farna during her life. Rorrik remained out of public view, knowing that the queen was the ruler her people needed to look to. However, many of the miracles she made happen would not have been possible without Rorrik’s help. For example, the crystal knives, or “widgets,” used to control Mirages were his invention.[~][~]Rorrik made it a point to keep his work shrouded in utmost secrecy, even from his children (or perhaps [f2]because[/f] they were his children). As a result, they arguably had less respect for him than their famous mother. Rorrik loved them too much to resent it, but his attempts to rein them in and discipline them rarely worked. Being a father was something he struggled with greatly.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_13_3;[#ff368c79]The Power of Architects[/#][~]Rorrik was an “Architect.” (This is not to be confused with the civic rank system established by Segwarides, a lie inspired by Rorrik’s powers.) Under the right set of conditions, Architects have the superhuman ability to create matter from nothing. Their creations make the imaginary real and defy the laws of nature—which puts Rorrik’s powers, like Lusse’s, on the same level as a god’s.[~][~]The artificial Nine Wood Hills in which Reynn and Lann slumbered was also of Rorrik’s construction. However, Lusse’s power was required to establish it as an actual world.[~][~]Together, the two of them had the power to create worlds, power history had never before seen. With the Farnas ruling Grymoire from on high, their contemporaries must have been convinced that their golden age of peace had begun.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_13_4;[#ff368c79]Rorrik’s Eyes[/#][~]You may have noted that, despite the deific power coursing through him, Rorrik did not manifest that power on his body, as with the sigils on Lusse’s arms. The reason for this is because his power came not from the hands, but from the mind. His sigil would have been on his brain, and while we never witnessed it during this story, his eyes transformed into something other than human whenever he used his abilities. Continued use of his skills caused his human eyesight to deteriorate terribly, to the point where he could not see at all without magical intervention.[~][~]Rorrik’s glasses are something he made with Lusse, and they allowed him to see past any illusion. Is it possible Lann’s imagination and abstract way of thinking are actually some sort of fail-safe to keep his abilities as an Architect in check? (Yes, that’s a serious question.)[~][~]

[f2]Oh no![/f] the Girl thought. [f2]She loves that world, and it’s going to be destroyed. Maybe it’s time to wake them up...[/f][~][~]No doubt you’ve figured it out, but this is the “girl with the ribbon” that showed up in Tama’s dreams.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_14_3;"[#ff368c79]A Fallen God[/#][~]The Girl came from outside the Realms of Fantasy created by Alexander (Enna Kros)
CHARACTER_JITEN_14_4;[#ff368c79](Probably) Safe[/#][~]Naturally, the Girl was the one to answer Tamamohimé’s call and help change Grymoire’s history, but the laws she leveraged to do so are alien to Grymoire and thus will not be expounded upon here.[~][~]A very small number of you may have been to the Girl’s original world before. And so an even smaller number may be curious: can the Sigma act upon Enna Kros’s Realms of Fantasy? The answer is no... At least, that’s not supposed to happen.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_14_5;[#ff368c79]Her True Identity[/#][~]Originally, her soul belonged to a girl who [f2]did[/f] have a name. In the world of Sigma Harmonics, this girl brought about a great miracle, but paid the price for it and became a sort of demi-demon: one with the power to meddle with history. After these events, she and the boy who was banished with her to the rift had their fates altered yet again, and became demon gods.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_14_6;[#ff368c79]Pocket of the Universe[/#][~]Before arriving in the strange space adjacent to Grymoire along with her big clock, the Girl had to travel there from the Extraverse. One such pathway was opened after the diabolos-king lost control of his own power over fantasy.[~][~]You might say something rather...[f2]big[/f]...happened in the world of the diabolos (largely due to the actions of Aris, a young man whose form Alexander sometimes takes). The Girl ended up fusing her powers of time with the diabolos’ powers of fantasy and creating a pocket in the universe from which she could control both.[~][~]It was in that world that Enna Kros (Alexander) gained her power to create the Realms of Fantasy, and ever since she and the Girl have been friends.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_14_7;[#ff368c79]Gods Get Around[/#][~]Enna Kros has her fingers in more than one dimensional pie, but she’s certainly not the only god with the power to traverse a multitude of worlds. Gods (like cats) get around. This means some pretty legitimate deities end up passing through the A-Worlds now and then. Thankfully, Enna Kros is laid-back and likeable enough that she (usually? mostly?) gets along with the rest of divine society without too much trouble.[~][~]But even if enemies do appear, gods or otherwise, she has built the A-Worlds to be nigh impervious to invaders. (The fact that it took the godlike Exnine Knights as long as it did to get even one foot in the door is testament to that.) A being on a higher plane might change the situation, but that’s why Alexander is seeking to become just such a god...by creating infinite Realms of Fantasy. It’s about quantity, not just quality.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_15_2;[#ff368c79]From Medium to Champion[/#][~]This legendary hero fights for truth, justice, and the Cornelian way.[~][~]When we first met the Warrior of Light, he was just another brigade captain in Cornelia’s royal army. However, after being touched by the twins’ mysterious light, he awakened as a Champion.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_15_3;[#ff368c79]Where Are the Other Warriors?[/#][~]In Grymoire, it was a nameless soldier who awakened as the Warrior of Light.[~][~]But the Warriors of Light take many forms in many worlds. Perhaps you know of a few yourself. And perhaps those other Warriors may set foot in Grymoire one day, if they have not already.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_15_4;[#ff368c79]Soul Searching[/#][~]Grymoire’s creator has marked certain people with unique and powerful souls as Mediums. Each Medium is a candidate with the potential to awaken as one of Grymoire’s greatest defenders, the Champions.[~][~]These souls are chosen from many worlds and copied over to an “A-World” like Grymoire in order to potentially become its Champion. But for the system to work, their lives must be reconstructed and adapted to the target world without changing the elements of their souls that made them so valuable in the first place.[~][~]Interestingly, though, they often go on to lead lives similar to those of their originals. They are not supposed to remember who or what they once were... But over innumerable years and innumerable lives, some of these recreated souls seem to retain hazy memories of lives past. The Warrior of Light is one such special case, but in Grymoire, he is not the only one.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_16_3;[#ff368c79]Summoners and Early Cornelia[/#][~]Legend says that the founder of Cornelia was a summoner, but Princess Sarah has inherited none of those abilities. Not that surprising, since in Grymoire, and especially among the Lilikin, such powers are rarely passed along family lines. In most cases, a summoner is chosen by an esper who recognizes her worth.[~][~]Records show that after Cornelia’s first age, no summoners have been born in the kingdom. As a result, the guardian and familiar of the kingdom itself, the Lute of Ragnarok, has lain in a deep sleep for generations.[~][~]

Has a whole bevy of different greetings for those who stop by her shop, only some of which make sense. It’s all about the attitude, and not the content![~][~]She’s also an extremely special case who has managed to retain her identity as she moves from world to world. The real mystery, of course, is deciding who the real Chocolatte is: the woman, or the chocochick on her head. ...What do you mean, [f2]it never crossed your mind?[/f][~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_17_3;[#ff368c79]Choco-stential Crisis[/#][~]Chocolatte used to go by the name Chocolina. But when she found herself in a world without Sazh and Dajh, she began to question her own identity. If the people who named her didn’t exist here, then wouldn’t she, by extension, be unable to know for certain whether she was, in fact, herself?[~][~]The more she considered it, the worse her existential crisis became...until the idea dawned on her to just become a new person. So voilà! New glasses, new name...totally different person, right?! Unfortunately, she has yet to fully convince the person who matters: herself.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_18_2;[#ff368c79]Leader Among Summoners[/#][~]There are few alive today in Grymoire who have the power of the summoners, and even fewer actively practicing the art. Worried that their legacy may soon die out, Yuna resolved to take up the burden of preserving their techniques for future generations. It’s stressful, but satisfying work.[~][~]Yuna is close with Rydia and Eiko. The two younger summoners admire Yuna’s maturity and look up to her as a kind of big sister. She tries to teach by example, but the strain of being “on” all the time was starting to get to her... That’s when she met Tidus. Although she still hasn’t realized it, he’s quickly becoming the person she leans on when things get tough.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_18_3;[#ff368c79]I’ll Come Running[/#][~]Anyone familiar with the original Yuna might remember a certain series of events during which she learned how to whistle. Lilikin or not, Grymoire or not, it’s hard not to smile when watching these two have a nostalgic little exchange like this.[~][~][~][#ff368c79]Developer’s Note[/#][~]We all really do love this gal. More than with any other character, we had people on the team complain fiercely that “Yuna would never do that!” during production. Still, the Grymoirian Yuna is the Grymoirian Yuna, and while we acknowledged everyone’s objections, we did our best to create a new Yuna while still paying homage to the old. We hope you like her as much as ever![~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_19_2;[#ff368c79]Daughter of Saronia[/#][~]Refia was chased out of house and home by her only living relative, her uncle Takka. Given no reason for her exile, she did her best to keep her spirits up and forget her troubles. However, when she saw the woes the people of Saronia faced as a Federation state, she could remain silent no longer. Ignoring the danger, she left to give her uncle a piece of her mind. But it was already too late...[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_19_3;[#ff368c79]Sherlotta’s Friend and Ward[/#][~]Sherlotta discovered Refia one day collapsed and freezing in the snow. She took in and cared for the exiled girl, and they’ve been fast friends ever since.[~][~]It may surprise you that the strong-willed, independent Refia could get along so well with the tough, no-nonsense Sherlotta. But Refia is a good-natured and honest girl. So while she might not show it, Refia will never forget that she owes Sherlotta her life.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_19_4;[#ff368c79]Why a White Mage?[/#][~]The original Refia had the ability to freely switch between multiple skillsets known as “jobs.” However, she was a white mage when her soul was noticed and brought into Grymoire, and so it was a white mage she became.[~][~]Life as a healer and her relationship with Sherlotta have shaped Refia. If she had been another job when her soul was brought over, she might have developed into an entirely different person.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_20_VOICEACTOR;CV: Stephanie Sheh / Marina Inoue
CHARACTER_JITEN_20_ORIGINAL;First World of Origin:[~][f2]FINAL FANTASY CRYSTAL CHRONICLES: Echoes of Time[/f][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_20_1;[#ff368c79]Age in Grymoire:[/#] Redacted by the, er, young lady in question[~](Apparently, reeeally old)[~][~][#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] Calm and composed due to age and experience / Has a menacing streak / Zero patience for foolishness / Runs an inn (but why?)[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_20_2;[#ff368c79]She’s a Kitty?![/#][~]Wait, why can she change into a feline? In her own words: “Cats get around.” Not the clearest answer, but it’s all you’re going to get.[~][~]Interesting fact! Sherlotta originally thought of Refia as nothing more than a stray cat she brought in from the cold. It’s probably for the best that Refia never caught on...[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_20_3;[#ff368c79]The Grymoirian Sherlotta[/#][~]Perhaps it’s an unavoidable side effect of living as long as she has, but Sherlotta tends to be distant and uninterested in the world around her. If she hadn’t sensed the goodness in Refia’s soul, she might have just left the girl out to freeze. Still, once she decides someone is worth saving, that person is in good hands.[~][~]Perhaps Sherlotta has come to think of Refia as a daughter, but don’t make the mistake of asking her. Can you imagine the thunder and the fury? “You idiot! I’m too young to be a mother!” And an angry Sherlotta is a fearsome Sherlotta indeed.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_20_4;[#ff368c79]Inseparable Souls[/#][~]If you’re convinced Sherlotta and the Undead Princess were made to mess with each other, you might just be right. As with many Mediums and Champions who had close ties in their original worlds, some force seems to draw Sherlotta and the Undead Princess together no matter [f2]what[/f] world they’re in.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_20_5;[#ff368c79]Sherlotta’s Secret[/#][~]You may also be wondering who Sherlotta really is, and if her history here parallels that of the original. At least one thing is different: in Grymoire, she can change her form at will.[~][~]Then again, Reynn and Lann can change into Lilikin form. Mirages can transfig themselves. Even Enna Kros changes her appearance depending on the world she’s visiting... Maybe the rules governing metamorphosis in the A-Worlds are pretty loose? Actually, let’s drop that subject.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_20_6;[#ff368c79]Overprotective?[/#][~]Sherlotta seemed hesitant to let Refia go into town. If you’ve played [f2]FINAL FANTASY CRYSTAL CHRONICLES: Echoes of Time[/f], then you might remember her fussing over someone [f2]else[/f] who wanted to go into town. What has she got against towns, anyway?[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_21_2;[#ff368c79]In League[/#][~]Even before meeting Lann and Reynn, Faris had her suspicions about the newly federated Saronia. This is why she formed a mutually beneficial relationship with a certain organization.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_21_3;[#ff368c79]Her Sworn Enemy[/#][~]Faris’s family has spent generations searching for a Mirage that crossed paths with an ancestor many long years ago...[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_21_4;[#ff368c79]Fighting Friends[/#][~]For some of you, it was obvious the moment Quistis showed up, but the “certain organization” Faris teamed up with is SeeD (one part of the League of S).[~][~]Quistis had come to Saronia to investigate the new chain binding the city and why the land stayed frozen year-round. However, it didn’t take long for her to run afoul of the feisty pirate Faris. Thankfully, beating the stuffing out of each other fostered a sort of mutual respect that developed into a strong friendship.[~][~]Since then, Quistis has helped Faris run goods, and Faris has been a valuable asset in the League’s covert operations.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_21_5;[#ff368c79]Leviathan[/#][~]Apparently the Mirage who hurt Faris’s ancestor was Bismarck, not Leviathan. Still, haughty as she is, Leviathan is not completely without conscience. Even if Reynn and Lann had not intervened on Faris’s behalf, you can be certain the Queen of the Sea would have sought Bismarck out and done him in.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_21_6;[#ff368c79]The Grymoirian Faris[/#][~]Faris has not forged relationships with the people she knew in her original world, nor does her sister seem to exist here either. As a result, Faris has had no reason to get in touch with her feminine side. But in that sense, Grymoire has allowed her to be herself.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_22_VOICEACTOR;CV: Kristina Pesic / Miyuki Sawashiro
CHARACTER_JITEN_22_ORIGINAL;First World of Origin:[~][f2]FINAL FANTASY VIII[/f][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_22_1;[#ff368c79]Age in Grymoire:[/#] 18[~][~][#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] Lass in glasses / Secret agent / Cautious and calculating / Generous enough to give away a fastcraft / Not generous enough to include a parachute[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_22_2;[#ff368c79]A Cunning Strategist[/#][~]Quistis is a wily and worldly woman who knows just what’s needed to grease the wheels of the political machine. When it came time to investigate Icicle Ridge, she immediately readied a juicy bribe for the thane—the fastcraft—but quickly shifted strategies in light of new information. While you might think her capricious for this, that is most certainly not the case. Quistis merely reallocated her resources to where they would do the most good. Once she learned Reynn and Lann were the Jiants from the Hills, she considered the prophecies and decided that helping the twins progress was a more productive course of action.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_22_3;[#ff368c79]SeeD’s Leader[/#][~]Quistis is SeeD’s leader. Her organization controls Balamb Garden and the airships—highly advanced technology that is beyond the ken of even Grymoire’s brightest minds. Funny, then, that even with all that at her disposal, one of her greatest passions is said to be a card game.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_22_4;[#ff368c79]The Wiser Choice[/#][~]When Quistis went up against Faris, she had no idea who she was dealing with. Faris’s kupirate crew was one thing. But when Syldra appeared, Quistis knew she was done for. Thus she challenged Faris to fisticuffs not because she thought she could win, but because taking a few punches seemed a lot better than, you know, dying.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_22_5;[#ff368c79]Squall’s Influence?[/#][~]Quistis is too busy running SeeD to step out onto the front lines. Is that why she wears glasses? Because she doesn’t have to worry about breaking them?[~][~]Then again, in some A-Worlds, she [f2]doesn’t [/f]wear glasses... Maybe she only does that when Squall is around. Or maybe that’s just, uh, [f2]spec-ulation[/f].[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_23_2;[#ff368c79]Marine Treasure Hunter[/#][~]After learning how to breathe underwater (patent pending), Rikku realized her time was best spent scouring the sea for awesome trejjies. She boasts that she can hold her breath for up to an entire day. (Aha! So apparently it’s [f2]not [/f]forever.)[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_23_3;[#ff368c79]Fashion Savvy[/#][~]Although she’s about the same age as she was in [f2]FINAL FANTASY X[/f], her outfit resembles the one she had in [f2]FINAL FANTASY X-2[/f].[~][~]In Grymoire, she still hasn’t met Yuna or Tidus. But if she ever does, they’re guaranteed to get along![~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_23_4;[#ff368c79]Gullwings Wanted![/#][~]Rikku is looking to make a career out of treasure hunting, and has started recruiting members for her team, which she’s calling “the Gullwings.”[~][~]Rikku bumped into Yuna on a recent excursion and immediately took a liking to her. Now, if she can just find a way to get Yuna to join up...[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_23_5;[#ff368c79]Trejjie-Wejjie, La La La La La![/#][~]Rikku and Bartz seemed to really hit it off, didn’t they? Their combined optimism and contagious spirit of adventure must have created some sort of perpetual energy loop that charged their fun meters to the max. Even Ifrit couldn’t help but get bowled over.[~][~](Although, Bartz did seem a little more self-aware than Rikku. Maybe he was just playing along?)[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_24_2;[#ff368c79]She’s There When You Need Her[/#][~]Even though Tifa had never met Reynn and Lann, she still put herself in danger to rescue them. Call it heroic or call it reckless, Tifa just isn’t the kind of woman to leave anyone stuck in a jam.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_24_3;[#ff368c79]Tifa’s Dream[/#][~]Tifa makes ends meet as a guide in Babil, but hopes to one day save up enough to open her own restaurant. She’d be in seventh heaven if she ever made it happen.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_24_4;[#ff368c79]Ready to Wrangle[/#][~]Tifa’s wearing her [f2]CRISIS CORE –FINAL FANTASY VII–[/f] outfit. However, she’s the same age as she was in [f2]FINAL FANTASY VII[/f].[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_24_5;[#ff368c79]A Childhood Friend[/#][~]When Tifa ran into Cloud during the Cogna invasion, she was shocked to discover that he was the same Cloud she grew up with. But whether or not Cloud remembers her is anyone’s guess.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_24_6;[#ff368c79]The Mysterious Master[/#][~]Tifa was badly hurt during a calamity that befell the village of Mist, which stood where Nibelheim does today. The man who would become her master just happened to be visiting the village and saved her life. Ever since, she’s been his loyal student and disciple in the martial arts.[~][~]And clearly, he doesn’t go easy on her. In fact, she now assumes that every horrible crisis she encounters must be some part of her master’s training. Which makes you wonder what he’s put her through...[~][~]Oh, and in case you’re wondering... Sorry! Tifa’s master will not be making an appearance this time.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_25_2;[#ff368c79]Bad Memories[/#][~]Rydia has a paralyzing fear of fire, brought on by the trauma she experienced when a calamity befell her home village of Mist. She lost her family that day, and even now sees the inferno that consumed them in every spark or flicker of flame. And try as she might, she has yet to overcome her phobia.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_25_3;[#ff368c79]Growing Up[/#][~]The original Rydia from [f2]FINAL FANTASY IV[/f] underwent a rather unique aging process during her time in the Feymarch, but here in Grymoire she has grown up at the same pace as any other girl. As a result, she’s a little bit more down-to-earth than you might remember.[~][~]Rydia’s mother was also a summoner, which makes the two of them a rarity in Grymoire, where Lilikin do not generally pass on such powers to their children.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_25_4;[#ff368c79]Fighting Fire[/#][~]Since meeting Reynn and Lann, Rydia has made great progress in overcoming her fear of flames. She’s still got a ways to go, but the healing has already begun.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_25_5;[#ff368c79]Her Mother’s Familiar[/#][~]When a familiar loses the summoner that brought them to a world, it also loses the source of magic that allows it to linger there. Once the magic their summoner invested in them finally fades, they must return whence they came.[~][~]However, some masterless familiars prove to be powerful, resourceful, and intelligent creatures. They secure sources of magic that allow them to remain in the world long after their summoners have died. The mist dragon Rydia’s mother summoned is one such Mirage.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_25_6;[#ff368c79]Prismarium Prison Breaks[/#][~]Among the Mirages that Reynn and Lann capture, some—like the seven known as the Pleiad—are powerful enough to secure their own magical sources, leave the confines of their prismariums, and wander about the world at will, even while their souls remain beholden. (If they are called upon, they are forcibly teleported back.)[~][~]However, this is only possible if the prismarium’s master is not paying attention. To put it simply, picture a heavy door in every prismarium that leads to the world outside. If the Mirage is strong enough and no one’s watching, it can push the door open and head along on its merry way. However, if the door is kept under lock and key, then no matter of pushing can force it open.[~][~]Long ago, Lann and Reynn captured a great number of Mirages, but left the doors to virtually all of their prismariums wide open and unguarded. Because of this, many Mirages—the Pleiad in particular—rampaged across Grymoire and made trouble for everyone. And Lann and Reynn, as the cause of this sorry state of affairs, became known as the Demon Dyad.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_26_4;[#ff368c79]Is Lightning Snow’s Sister?[/#][~]Snow called Lightning “Sis,” but are they related? Well, not by blood. But as you may have guessed, Snow and Lightning’s relationship here is essentially the same as it was in their original world.[~][~]Unfortunately, Lightning’s younger sister doesn’t make an appearance this time, but perhaps one day she’ll rise as a Champion and you’ll have a chance to meet her.[~][~]

And yet, he insists that he isn’t a summoner.[~][~]Summoners are individuals who open pathways to other worlds, then use their magic to form pacts with Mirages. However, Snow is different. Unlike a summoner, Snow was given a power—some consider it a curse—that turned his left arm into a sort of magical instrument. Channeling magic through it, he made a pact with Shiva-Ixion.[~][~]In Snow’s original world, this would brand him as a l’Cie

But does that mean her soul might actually be over 500 years old? No wonder it only took her 21 years in Grymoire to become something of a living legend—and that was [f2]before[/f] the twins awakened her.[~][~]Lightning’s superhuman skills drew the attention of Quistis and Squall, who tracked her down and persuaded her to lend her strength to the League of S.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_27_3;[#ff368c79]Careless?[/#][~]Between failing to catch the poison in Lann and Reynn’s drinks and letting the bad guys get the upper hand, the Grymoirian Lightning seems to be surprisingly careless. Maybe it’s because the burdens she bears are relatively light, and she’s never been in quite as desperate a situation as her original. Note that she puts a surprising amount of faith in her allies in the League of S. Maybe she knows it’s okay to slip up now and then if you have friends to lean on. And that makes her a little more human.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_28_1;[#ff368c79]Age in Grymoire:[/#] 27[~][~][#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] King of Figaro / Owns a big sand castle (sort of) / Loves the ladies / “The churl never gets the girl” / Voiced by a true FF fan[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_28_2;[#ff368c79]An Eye for the Ladies[/#][~]Day after day, Edgar struggles with an ethical quagmire from which he just can’t escape. On the one hand, he [f2]must[/f] flirt with [f2]all[/f] the ladies. On the other, he knows that this can be taken as rude, and one should never be rude to a lady. What to do?![~][~]Additionally, Edgar still hasn’t quite decided where to draw the line between “girl” and “lady.” It seems that Reynn falls into the former category, and not the latter.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_28_3;[#ff368c79]The Desert Castle[/#][~]Edgar’s castle rose from the sands with a tremor and a roar. Although its chain-like leash might suggest the Federation had a hand in such a trick, Figaro Castle’s ability to submerge is uniquely its own.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_28_4;[#ff368c79]Figaro Castle, Midgar, and the Underground Prison[/#][~]Strap yourselves in, because we’re breaking the fourth wall.[~][~]Figaro Castle is, without a doubt, the most preposterous facility in all of Grymoire. To be honest, it never made any sense. A castle that can burrow into sand? How does that even work?![~][~]Well, we’ve ratcheted up the implausible factor to the max by strapping a facility named after [f2]FFVII’s[/f] Midgar to the bottom of it, complete with [f2]DIRGE of CERBERUS’s[/f] Mako Reactor 0. Add to the mix one boss straight out of [f2]FFIX[/f]—hi, Vivi! To top it all off, if you look at the submerged portion of the castle, it’s painfully obvious from the construction that it’s an evolved version of the drills on that desert prison in [f2]FFVIII[/f]...[~][~]Honestly, even we think we might have gone too far this time.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_28_5;[#ff368c79]Eidolons as Living Structures[/#][~]Enna Kros hints at this, but in case you didn’t catch it: in every A-World, massive eidolons can take the form of buildings or weapons. In Grymoire, there are at least four known examples of this:[~]- Big Bridge Alexander[~]- Eden of Balamb[~]- The Lute of Ragnarok[~]- The Midgardian Ormr[~](And in fact, there’s one more, but we’ll save that for another entry.)[~][~]Eiko is Big Bridge Alexander’s caretaker. The Eden of Balamb is guarded by Quistis, Squall, and SeeD. The Lute of Ragnarok, Cornelia’s guardian, has been revived and magically charged by Ramuh’s Judgment Staff. And the Midgardian Ormr sleeps beneath Figaro Castle, under Edgar’s watchful eye.[~][~]The Ormr stands out because no one has realized yet that it is an eidolon. And that suits it just fine for now, since it is able to convert Grymoire’s geotic energy into mako whenever it requires more magic.[~][~]When eidolons and Mirages materialize in a new world, oftentimes they don’t quite fully make it. When this happens, their primary characteristics are emphasized and reforged into a new form, such as a specialized facility or a powerful weapon. Long, long ago, some Cogna failed to push their way into Roksanne and Aris’s world. The weapons they became were discovered and wielded by great heroes. But this directly led to a Cogna invasion, which in turn invited the creation of a new, terrifying type of being: the amalgamations known as the Exnine Knights.[~][~]

But in order to elude the Federation’s agents, he disguised himself as a prisoner in rags.[~][~]You can see the captain takes his job seriously—he spent [f2]hours [/f]writing all his lines.

CHARACTER_JITEN_30_2;[#ff368c79]SeeD[/#][~]SeeD is a group of elite mercenaries whose current primary focus is overthrowing the Bahamutian Federation. Its ranks include such notable figures as Squall and Quistis.[~][~]King Edgar of Figaro hired SeeD to help free his castle from the Federation’s chain. SeeD’s support was invaluable in this operation, and they provided crucial support to the forcibly drafted heroes of the day, Lann and Reynn.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_30_3;[#ff368c79]The League of S[/#][~]Cloud and Shelke work for Shinra, and Squall and Quistis work for SeeD. When these two powerful groups joined forces against the Bahamutian Federation, they became a powerful alliance known as the League of S—which, as you’ve figured out by now, comes from the first letter of their names.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_30_4;[#ff368c79]The League’s Troubled History[/#][~]Shinra and SeeD—their alliance poses a formidable threat to the Bahamutian Federation.[~][~]However, their cause saw a major setback when a mysterious incident at Shinra’s former HQ in Nibelheim resulted in the disappearance of its researchers and top brass. After the incident, SeeD stepped in and assumed command of Shinra’s mercenary group, known as SOLDIER. This is why Cloud and Shelke now report to Quistis.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_30_5;[#ff368c79]SeeD’s Headquarters[/#][~]The floating city of Balamb Garden serves as SeeD’s airborne base of operations. However, until Eiko took a closer look, no one had ever suspected the Garden was actually a colossal eidolon.[~][~]Occasionally, alien technology is found in Grymoire: strange artifacts from places and eras unknown. SeeD has worked tirelessly to find this technology and exploit it in their fight against the Federation. The airships they used to discover Balamb Garden are a perfect example.[~][~]The Garden itself also proved to be a gold mine of useful tech: drawing, junctioning, and weapons like the gunblade. With the support of Shinra’s brilliant researchers, these discoveries were modernized and put into practice.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_30_6;[#ff368c79]Leadership Material[/#][~]Squall has always been a man of few words—a lone wolf. However, with so few fighters of his caliber to choose from, SeeD has had to keep Squall on the front lines, where his comrades expect him to get them through the danger. As a result, he’s more of a leader than he knows.[~][~]In case you’re wondering, Seifer doesn’t exist here in Grymoire, so someone else gave Squall that scar on his face. Rumor has it that when he first started training with Cloud and Lightning, he went home every day covered with scrapes and bruises. You don’t think that one of them...?[~][~]This may surprise you, but Squall is the youngest core member of the League of S. (Yup, even younger than Shelke!) His poise and experience make him seem older than he actually is.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_31_2;"[#ff368c79]Countertek[/#][~]Shelke is a master of Countertek, an impressive skill that allows her to neutralize other techniques and mechanisms. However, it cannot act on latent forces. This is why she pushed Lann and Reynn as hard as she did

The Tsviets’ members have colors for code names, but Shelke’s code name—Shelke the Transparent—sets her apart as special, even among her already extraordinary peers.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_31_4;[#ff368c79]Emotionally Detached[/#][~]The nightmares Diabolos subjected Shelke to were twisted versions of reality—but they were still, to some extent, true.[~][~]Shelke’s life has not been sugar and rainbows, and she’s learned to cut herself off from her emotions in order to cope. Additionally, it’s in her nature to put all her energy into the task at hand, so she frequently overlooks details she has determined don’t matter. For example, she only realized the strangeness of a Mirage like Tama talking when Vivi pointed it out to her.[~][~]All the same, the lack of distractions gives her complete objectivity, so she’s surprisingly good at reading [f2]other [/f]people’s feelings. Ironic, isn’t it?[~][~]

In the heat of the resulting battle, he unexpectedly becomes self-aware.[~][~]In Grymoire, Vivi is the only Black Mage from the reactor to gain powers of speech.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_32_3;[#ff368c79]The Keys’ Hidden Purpose[/#][~]When the four keys were hidden, each also served as a sort of cork to bottle up the power of one of the Pleiad. Such was their magic.[~][~]The keys also served as a kind of trap, luring Mirages like flies to their honey. After being discarded, the Black Mages gravitated toward the Key of Earth, and the most powerful among them, Vivi, came to possess the key.[~][~]Was that all part of Enna Kros’s grand strategy? Whatever the case, it turned out to be extremely fortunate for Lann and Reynn.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_32_4;[#ff368c79]The Black Mages[/#][~]Over the past hundred years, Segwarides has dabbled in a number of experiments only to cast them aside. The Black Mages were his attempt to create a sort of spell-slinging golem (with a fail-safe, of course).[~][~]So how is it one of the so-called Herald’s creations came to possess the soul of a Medium? (Yes, that’s right.) Perhaps Enna Kros had a few more tricks up her sleeve than anyone realized.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_32_5;[#ff368c79]Friend of Figaro[/#][~]Seeing as Vivi gained sentience in Edgar’s domain (or under it, if you want to nitpick), the king felt it was only right to give him and his brethren a chance to find their place and purpose in Figaro.[~][~]Since then, Vivi in particular has begun to look up to Edgar, both as a leader and as an adult— Wait, is that okay?! Edgar, a role model? Well, don’t panic. Vivi’s heart is pure enough to guide him along his own path...probably.[~][~]Are you worried about his future? Well, all of that works differently here in Grymoire, even if it is still uncertain.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_33_2;[#ff368c79]Kindergarten Summoner[/#][~]Despite her tender age of 6, Eiko is already a skilled summoner. Not only that, she’s more independent than many people five times her age. She passes her days caring for and watching over Big Bridge, both for the sake of passing travelers and for Alexander himself. To sum it up, this little girl’s competence levels are actually kind of frightening.[~][~]Sadly, Big Bridge doesn’t see much foot traffic, so Eiko sometimes gets lonely. When visitors come a-stopping by, she always strikes up a long conversation.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_33_3;[#ff368c79]Fond Friends[/#][~]By the time Eiko was old enough to walk, she had already gained the knowledge, skill, and poise required to be a first-class summoner. It’s a shame her family isn’t around to see how far she has come... Oh, but don’t worry, it’s not what you think. Eiko simply decided to strike out on her own. (Calling her “precocious” would be an understatement.)[~][~]Eiko is very fond of Rydia and Lady Yuna, and they see each other quite often. In a way, they have become her new family.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_33_4;[#ff368c79]The Fenrir Primes[/#][~]Eiko used to live alongside moogles and other Mirages. Now that she’s a full-fledged summoner, she is accompanied only by her familiar, Fenrir, with whom she shares her magic.[~][~]Eiko’s Fenrir may bear a striking similarity to the fenrirs you get by transfigging white nakks, but his soul is actually a little different. Eiko’s Fenrir is a special variant called a “prime.” The primes govern the power of the moon, and are not to be trifled with.[~][~]Still, if Lann and Reynn manage to transfig a white nakk, they can get a glimpse of the fenrir tribe’s true glory.[~][~]Summoners call the original souls of their familiars from their original worlds, which, as you’ll come to learn, makes them very different from Mirage Keepers. One thing is for certain: most familiars are far more powerful than your run-of-the-mill Grymoirian Mirage.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_34_2;[#ff368c79]Road Warrior[/#][~]Wherever the wind blows, there you will find Bartz and his constant companion, Boko. Sometimes treasure hunter, sometimes monster hunter, sometimes champion of justice—whatever Bartz is up to today, you know it’ll be for the good of those in need. No matter how difficult the challenge, he’ll solve it with style and aplomb before disappearing into the sunset.[~][~]Bartz’s quest to explore the world isn’t mere fancy, but rather the dying wish of his father.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_34_3;[#ff368c79]Carefree[/#][~]Nothing can contain Bartz’s boundless enthusiasm and thirst for adventure. With a sack over his shoulder and a song in his heart, he travels from place to place, a smile on his lips as he faces even the most hopeless of situations. He can even match the ever-exuberant Rikku’s excitement levels, and that’s no easy feat.[~][~]Perhaps Bartz has doubts and worries like anyone else, and never lets them show. Or...maybe he really is just that carefree. But once Bartz decides to involve himself in something, he’ll see it through to the end. “Never give up” is his motto, and he never has.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_34_4;[#ff368c79]Gilgamesh and I[/#][~]Bartz has a stalker he just can’t shake, and that stalker’s name is Gilgamesh. The Bartz here in Grymoire hasn’t the slightest inkling why, but back in their world of origin, they have [f2]quite [/f]the history.[~][~]Although Gilgamesh is [f2]extremely [/f]irritating, he’s not really a villain. In fact, a man who sticks by his creed [f2]that [/f]doggedly deserves some admiration.

Although he was born in the same world as Bartz, he spent a long, long time wandering the space between dimensions. As such, his memories and his obsession with Bartz have been imprinted upon his soul itself.[~][~]So even though his Grymoirian self is just a copy, Gilgamesh still retains some of the emotions his original had.

Gilgamesh is destined to fight Bartz (but he doesn’t know why).[~]2. Bartz must be destined to fight Gilgamesh. (Obviously.)[~]3. Therefore, the only person who would dare fight him is Bartz! (Because...right?)[~][~]With this ironclad reasoning behind him, Gilgamesh assumes Snow must be a shape-shifted Bartz, and the rest is history.

She’s a little peeved about not being able to go out, but likes Cid enough to let it slide...most of the time.[~][~]Celes’s time in the military has made her terse and businesslike when dealing with strangers, but once she gets to know you, she really opens up.[~][~]

Well, the Federation has been selling this story for a hundred years—more than enough time for the populace to build up a kind of blind faith. And faith is a tough thing to dismantle, even with rational thinking.

The truth is, Cid was mortally wounded while fleeing from the Federation and would have died if he hadn’t switched bodies.[~][~]That said, he [f2]is [/f]pretty happy that he no longer needs to sleep. More time for books! Other benefits of mechanization include limited rocket boosters (great for accessing those hard to reach bookshelves) and never having to worry about getting a paper cut. Cid always did have a talent for finding the shiny silver lining on any cloud.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_38_4;[#ff368c79]Part of the Tradition[/#][~]He’s taken a number of roles and personalities over the years, but one thing’s for certain: it’s not FINAL FANTASY unless there’s a Cid! He’s even found his way into the spinoffs.[~][~]Interestingly enough, Cid’s soul wasn’t brought to Grymoire like the other classic characters. However, the powers that be must have understood that [f2]conceptually, [/f]someone named Cid [f2]has [/f]to be born for the whole Champion System thing to even work. And that’s how Grymoire got its own unique Cid.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_39_1;[#ff368c79]Age in Grymoire:[/#] Late 40s, according to Besaid’s older folk[~](Pressing Shantotto for details is not advised)[~][~][#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] Doctor / Pantologist / Curse professional / Black magic expert / Speaks in rhyme / “Ahhh, ha ha ha ha!” / Overbearing, but a certifiable genius / Do not make her angry[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_39_2;[#ff368c79]Always There to Assist?[/#][~]When someone tells you that they’re a specialist in curses, you immediately think bad thoughts. Still, a tool isn’t good or bad in and of itself. It’s all about how you use it, and Shantotto uses her knowledge of the hexing arts to solve problems for those in need. So curse or not, it can be a good thing! Now that that’s settled, who wants one?[~][~]Shantotto’s original soul was Tarutaru, a race known for their diminutive stature (not that it stopped her from towering above others in spirit, mind you). Luckily, here on Grymoire, everyone is already pretty tiny. When Shantotto’s soul was born into a Lilikin body, her vertical challenges vanished.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_39_3;[#ff368c79]Just Getting Started[/#][~]Shantotto is the oldest Medium you’ll meet in Grymoire (if you exclude Sherlotta and people removed from time’s normal flow). That said, she still hasn’t reached the age the original Shantotto was during the Crystal War. In other words, Shantotto’s still got plenty of time to do great things in Grymoire.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_39_4;[#ff368c79]She’s on Your Side, Honest[/#][~]Shantotto’s pursuits are so lofty that she frequently forgets to connect with mere layfolk. And let’s face it: her mastery of black magic and curses doesn’t help public relations much, either. But as evil as her hobbies make her sound, one thing should be infinitely clear: no matter what schemes she’s got bubbling around in that mysterious head of hers, you can bet it’s always for the greater good.[~][~]Shantotto has a proven track record in Besaid, and knows exactly how to keep the locals safe and happy. So if you thought she’d completely lost her mind when she tried to do the Quacho Queen in—never fear! Everything she does has a purpose.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_40_2;[#ff368c79]Blitzball[/#][~]Tidus lives in Besaid, and as you might have guessed, he’s the best blitzball player around. Sadly, Besaid doesn’t seem to have one of those impressive spherical stadiums.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_40_3;[#ff368c79]Athletic Abilities Off the Chart[/#][~]Tidus was born to swim and play sports, and he uses his boundless stamina and agility to deal with rogue Mirages and other troubles in the waters off Besaid.[~][~]He’s also gotten pretty handy with a sword. The fact that he almost measures up to the League of S’s more seasoned fighters like Squall, Cloud, and Lightning should tell you a lot about what he’s physically capable of.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_40_4;"[#ff368c79]Tidus and Shantotto[/#][~]Shantotto calls Tidus the “jock with the gills of a flounder,” so it may seem as if she doesn’t think much of him. On the contrary, they often work together to help the people of Besaid, and she values his talents quite highly. So don’t let the unidirectional harsh wording fool you
CHARACTER_JITEN_40_5;[#ff368c79]Just a Really Nice Guy[/#][~]Nothing can stop Tidus once he sets his mind on something. If you ask him for help, this brave and good-natured youth will never let you down.[~][~]When Yuna was kidnapped, Tidus chased her kidnapper all the way up the Crystal Tower. Some might call that idiotic, especially since he’d barely had any battle training. But he was thinking with his heart, and that’s nothing to sniff at.[~][~]Since the battle with Bismarck, Tidus and Yuna seem much closer. Perhaps their real journey is just about to begin.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_41_2;[#ff368c79]Enslaved[/#][~]Terra grew up on the same continent as Celes, although they were not acquainted. She was another victim of Segwarides’ many experiments.[~][~]She may seem quiet and frail, but her courage and strength of will are superhuman. Terra fought hard to break free of Segwarides’ slave crown and warn Reynn and Lann of the Heralds’ plans. (She failed to get her message across, but considering the state she was in, that’s understandable.)[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_41_3;[#ff368c79]Not a Summoner[/#][~]This may be a bit confusing, but Terra is [f2]not [/f] a summoner, even in Grymoire. While it may have appeared that her role in Segwarides’ grand plan was the same as the captured summoners—Yuna, Eiko, and Rydia—she actually functioned as more of a catalyst to the other three in his sinister ritual.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_41_4;[#ff368c79]Terra’s Birthright[/#][~]Terra was the fruit of an unlikely love between a Mirage (an esper) and a human. Her heritage enables her to interact with espers in a fundamentally different way from summoners, granting her the ability to call upon and control them—even against their will.[~][~]Terra’s unique talents caught the eye of Segwarides. Even knowing she was a Medium, he decided to take the risk, enslave her, and use her powers. However, Segwarides underestimated Terra’s strength and the tenacity of her esper guardian, Maduin, and soon discovered she was a difficult pawn to put into play. In the end, his clumsy efforts caused her to lose control completely—and there, his scheme should have fallen apart.[~][~]It was Lann and Reynn who defeated Terra, her armor, and Maduin in one fell swoop. Segwarides could barely contain his glee as he scooped up Terra’s unconscious body and linked her to the Ultima Gate. Once again, the twins had unwittingly furthered his plot.[~][~]Terra has yet to learn of her origins or her potential. For now, she spends her time with Yuna and the other summoners, hoping to one day become a summoner herself.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_41_5;[#ff368c79]Cogna Vs. Machine[/#][~]The main difference between the Cogna already in Grymoire (those beneath Figaro, or Terra’s Magitek armor) and the ones Brandelis summoned through the Ultima Gate is the nature of their souls.[~][~]The Cogna can be divided into two main categories: sentient Cogna that possess wills and souls of their own, and empty Cogna that do not. Sentient Cogna seek to propagate and destroy worlds. The empty ones, however, cannot reacquire a soul or propagate, and are therefore unlikely to pose a threat to the world.[~][~]Terra’s Magitek armor falls into the latter category, although it is largely a customized model created by Segwarides.[~][~]In case you were wondering, when Lann and Reynn capture Cogna in eldboxes, the eldbox copies merely the physical form, and not the Cogna’s soul.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_41_6;"[#ff368c79]The Magitek Armor and Maduin[/#][~]The black Magitek armor that Terra controls is unique—an artificial Cogna Segwarides created just for her. Terra never suspected this

CHARACTER_JITEN_42_2;[#ff368c79]A Series Regular[/#][~]Putting the conductor aside for a moment, cactuars in general first appeared in [f2]FINAL FANTASY VI[/f] and have made their prickly mark on every numbered title since. They’re known for their lightning quick reflexes and their 1,000 Needles attack.[~][~]So which cactuar have we got here? Well, if you look at the jerky animation and assume the conductor’s soul was brought to Grymoire from the FFVIII era, then you might be onto something.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_42_3;[#ff368c79]Lord of Locomotion[/#][~]The Cactuar Conductor single-handedly runs and mans a network of trains found in every corner of Grymoire. He’s also a master of dodging.

CHARACTER_JITEN_42_4;[#ff368c79]Peachy Keen[/#][~]Maybe you’ve heard the expression the conductor used—“peachy keen”—once or twice before. Did you know where it comes from, though? About fifty years ago, “keen” was another word for “cool.” And fifty years before that, folks called cool things “peachy.”[~][~]Makes you wonder if people a century from now will be saying things like “phat diggity” or “totes bodacious” or “carpe YOLO.” (Cringe.) Let’s just hope we’re not around to see the worst of the fallout.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_43_1;[#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] Coliseum manager / Gentleman / Calm and collected / Everybody’s grudge...or is it just karma?[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_43_2;[#ff368c79]A Series Regular[/#][~]Ah, the tonberry. Ever since their first FINAL FANTASY appearance, these disturbing yet lovable creatures have appeared in nearly every installment.[~][~]In the English-speaking world, they went through a bit of an identity crisis at first. For some reason tonberries were initially called “pugs,” despite looking nothing like dogs. Then again, they don’t look like berries either...[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_43_3;[#ff368c79]The Coliseum[/#][~]The fog surrounding the Coliseum connects it to other worlds: specifically, a set of divergent possible histories that have manifested as parallel worlds. Those [f2]other [/f]worlds have [f2]other [/f]Coliseums run by [f2]other [/f]tonberries, who all work together to arrange contests of sport across what we’ll just call the Interspace for now.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_43_4;[#ff368c79]Parallel Worlds[/#][~]The Coliseum’s true name is “Battle Arena Alexander.” That’s right—the Coliseum is actually a massive esper like Big Bridge.[~][~]If we can get metaphysical for a moment, Enna Kros (aka the god Alexander) has created each of her worlds, including Grymoire, as an “array” of possibilities. The world’s history diverges at random (but dimensionally feasible) points to create multiple possible outcomes, and each of these potential courses exists as its own parallel world within the array. While Enna Kros only maintains enough instances of each world as needed for an outside group of intermediaries or “players,” the array still acts as ample insurance to prevent the world from being doomed by a single catastrophic turn of events.[~][~]Battle Arena Alexander, who was summoned to Grymoire by Enna Kros, is able to generate a special mist that allows it to connect to other parallel worlds in the array (in a limited capacity that poses no threat to the other worlds’ stability).[~][~]However, like all espers that have manifested as structures, the Coliseum does very little in the way of thinking, and so it requires a manager to ensure fights are run properly. Ever since winning the first WOFF Battle Championship, the Master Tonberry and his descendants have assumed this responsibility. The current Coliseum manager is the 42nd Master Tonberry in his line.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_44_2;[#ff368c79]A Series Regular[/#][~]Since their first appearance in a FINAL FANTASY game, the moogles and their trademark “kupo” have gone on to appear in a number of stories inside and outside the FF universe. They’re something of a mascot.[~][~]In [f2]FINAL FANTASY VI[/f], moogles popped up on a black screen to provide players with hints. That seems to have cemented their role in FF history as guides and purveyors of various player-friendly services.[~][~]In our tale, Mog conveniently shows up to tell the twins about the keys they need. Does that make him a “deus ex mogina”?[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_44_3;[#ff368c79]Transfig Fashion[/#][~]So, you may be wondering if a kupirate is just a regular moogle in fancy clothes. Not so! Just like with any other Mirage, Mog here is able to transfig in and out of kupirate form. It certainly helps him save on closet space.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_44_4;[#ff368c79]Moogle Mischief[/#][~]Most moogles you’ll meet are unrepentant pranksters, and this one’s no different. Playfulness appears to be built right into their pom-poms.[~][~]

In another time and another place (okay, actually another game), they were originally going to team up as the “Cranberry Knights.” Sadly, due to unavoidable circumstances, that particular tale had to go untold.

So while this may appear to be an ordinary chocochick, [f2]she’s [/f]the one calling the shots. [f2]She’s [/f]the master.[~][~]That said, you can more or less consider human and bird to be one in body and spirit.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_47_3;[#ff368c79]Cognification[/#][~]When the Mecha Chocobo saw the strength of Boko’s mind, body, and spirit—honed as they were through years of travel with Bartz—it abducted Boko and attempted to transform him into a loyal Cogna. Luckily, Bartz and Chocolatte came to the rescue and thwarted the Mecha Chocobo’s plans.[~][~]However, don’t count this villain out for good.

That was when Bartz appeared on the scene, and ever since, they’ve been the closest of friends.[~][~]Mirages and humans bond easily on Grymoire, and this goes doubly so for those whose original souls were linked in incarnations past. The summoners and their familiars, Faris and Syldra, Terra and Maduin, Bartz and Boko, even Gilgamesh and Enkidu—the examples are too numerous to count.[~][~]In the case of Boko and Bartz, their souls pulled the two of them together like a set of powerful magnets.[~][~]

Refer to them as espers, GFs, eidolons, aeons, avatars, primals, whatever you want—but if there’s a supernatural superforce to call on, you can bet Ifrit is somewhere in the lineup. Along with Shiva and Ramuh, he’s one of the most familiar faces in the summon community.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_49_3;[#ff368c79]Extremely Dangerous?[/#][~]The Grymoirian Ifrit has a reputation for being ill-tempered and violent. But contrary to public opinion, he is actually a very decent Mirage who cares deeply for the people of Grymoire. He’s even taken it upon himself to make sure no one accidentally stumbles into the Nether Nebula and gets hurt. To this purpose, he takes full advantage of the rumors about him, and leaps out to frighten any who wander in.[~][~]His fondness for humans puts him at clear odds with another, less savory Mirage in his tribe...[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_49_4;[#ff368c79]The Nether Nebula: Part 1[/#][~]Some Mirages, especially those known as “espers,” have been summoned to Grymoire from their various homeworlds.[~][~]Espers cannot travel between worlds on their own and, as a rule of thumb, only appear outside their homeworlds when called there by summoners. However, there are some places, like the Nether Nebula, where the barrier between worlds is thin enough to make the crossing.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_50_2;"[#ff368c79]Extremely Dangerous![/#][~]In their homeworld, the ifrits come in all shapes and sizes. The sheer variety of espers out there explains why an esper summoned in one world might be completely different from an esper of the same tribe summoned in another.[~][~]Females like Ifreeta are a rarity among her tribe. It’s not just gender that sets her apart, though. She also has the ability to devour human souls to increase her own strength. She’s got a bad habit of strolling from world to world, munching on any soul that catches her eye... She’s actually quite terrifying, isn’t she? You can see why the kind and caring Ifrit dislikes her so much.[~][~]But there’s more to Ifreeta’s soul-eating powers than just a hungry tummy. Her inner fire is similar to a phoenix’s flames
CHARACTER_JITEN_50_3;[#ff368c79]Pinch Hitters[/#][~]You may be wondering why Ifreeta called Rydia and Yuna “pinch hitters” after they took her down. Well, Ifreeta had been to her share of A-Worlds, and while battling in one of them she learned how the Champion System works: by replicating souls from other worlds. So you see, to her, Rydia and Yuna were no better than a pair of puppets who had stepped in to do someone else’s dirty work.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_51_2;[#ff368c79]A Series Regular[/#][~]Shiva has been diamond-dusting ever since the summoning system made its debut. And like Ifrit and Ramuh, she’s a core member of the FF lineup who has shown up in almost every FINAL FANTASY since.[~][~]Shiva’s gone through a lot of changes over the years. She’s turned up as a motorcycle and a kind of super ice skater, had a family and [f2]not [/f]had a family... Icy as she is, she’s never let her image freeze up.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_51_3;[#ff368c79]Not on Bridge Duty[/#][~]As you may have figured out, the shiva that specializes in making bridges is the one that hangs with Snow. That’s not to say [f2]this [/f]Shiva is incapable of making a bridge—and, in fact, Sherlotta managed to taunt her into it—but she certainly isn’t about to go out of her way to do any extra work.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_51_4;"[#ff368c79]Manhandler[/#][~]Shiva tried to march right on home once she saw that Sherlotta and Refia weren’t accompanied by a cadre of hunky guys—but what exactly would she have done if there [f2]were [/f]men present? Freeze ’em up and use ’em to decorate her room? If you think about it, Shiva’s been cooling her heels in the Nether Nebula for a while now...

CHARACTER_JITEN_51_5;[#ff368c79]The Nether Nebula: Part 2[/#][~]In places where the barrier between worlds is thin, an esper with the right knowledge doesn’t need a summoner, because they can use the magic within any suitable human being as a conduit. In a word, they can summon themselves.[~][~]However, a number of unlikely conditions need to first be met: the barrier must be thin enough, the esper must be clever enough, and a powerful enough human conduit must wander within reach. Naturally, this makes such crossings a very rare occurrence.[~][~]

He’s as stubborn as an unfed chocobo and simply [f2]refuses [/f]to be reasoned with. At least, that’s what Shiva will tell you.[~][~]Also, in case you’re wondering: just as there are relatively few ifrit females, there are relatively few shiva males.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_52_3;[#ff368c79]Not Technically a Villain[/#][~]Why did Shivalry declare with such certainty that Shiva-Ixion was evil? Chalk it up to experience. While traveling from world to world and righting wrongs (whether wrong or right), Shivalry has come up against the Exnine Knights and the Cogna enough times to know they’re bad news.[~][~]So when he saw that Shiva-Ixion had a little machine in her, he decided it was his sacred duty as Chief of the Shiva Justice Police to stop her before she could shame their tribe. Of course, this was all a big misunderstanding.[~][~]So is he a villain? No. Is he a good guy? Also probably no. Let’s not forget that to get into Grymoire in the first place, he had to bust his way through an innocent human. Whatever you want to call that kind of stunt, justice it just [f2]isn’t.[/f][~][~]

If anything, he tends to play a more important role those times that he does show up.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_53_3;"[#ff368c79]Bald, or Bold?[/#][~]Ramuh may look like he’s seen a lot of winters, but that’s just how he presents himself in Grymoire. Don’t assume that he’s actually ancient
CHARACTER_JITEN_53_4;[#ff368c79]The Nether Nebula: Part 3[/#][~]As rare as it is for espers to force their way across worlds, Lusse’s predecessor’s predecessor knew that even one such crossing could be disastrous. And so, the then-Queen of the Keepers tasked three of the Pleiad—Ifrit, Shiva, and Ramuh—to erect a special tri-elemence barrier in the Nether Nebula to prevent this from ever coming to pass.[~][~]For many years, the barrier worked. But unbeknownst to Ramuh, Ifrit and Shiva had been sneaking away from the Nebula to goof around. And this time, they allowed two [f2]really [/f]bad apples to slip into Grymoire...[~][~]

A run-in with a Cogna provided just the ticket

CHARACTER_JITEN_55_ORIGINAL;First Worlds of Origin:[~][f2]FINAL FANTASY II[/f] : As an unseen menace[~][f2]FINAL FANTASY III[/f] : As the eidolon[~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_55_1;[#ff368c79]A Series Regular[/#][~]While Leviathan doesn’t grace quite as many FF titles as some of her peers, she’s notable for her range. She’s given crucial roles in some stories, and is relegated to the deep in others, but you’ll never forget her once you see her.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_55_2;[#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] One of the Pleiad / Queen of the Deep / Maligned as a sea-demon / “Currently” on holiday in the Low Seas[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_55_3;[#ff368c79]Capricious Queen[/#][~]After spending a century under lock and...well, [f2]key[/f], Leviathan was ready to cut loose. A well-deserved cruise was in order—a chance to see how her ocean kingdom had changed. No wonder she was so annoyed by Addy’s interruption. As ancient as he is, she called him “little adamantoise,” which seems to suggest she’s been alive for unfathomable generations.[~][~]Leviathan has always done what suits her in the moment, and she can quickly swing from friendly ally to terrifying foe. However, she has no less than a brilliant mind. Presented with Faris and Syldra’s misguided grudge, she could have crushed them where they stood, or else tried to clear things up. But instead, she made the wiser decision to humor the grudge and pretend to lose. Whimsical? Yes, but also generous at times.[~][~]Then again, if Faris (and Reynn and Lann) weren’t strong enough, Leviathan probably would have let that same whimsy of hers smash them to pieces. Take nothing for granted with the Queen of the Deep.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_55_4;[#ff368c79]Not Fond of Bismarck[/#][~]Few Mirages get on Leviathan’s nerves quite like Bismarck. He’s just a puny little weakling, and yet he [f2]dares [/f]to oppose her... Unforgivable![~][~]It’s no wonder, then, that Leviathan chose to side with Faris’s great-grandfather when Bismarck attacked him. But then it’s [f2]also [/f]no wonder that she left Tycoon to fend for himself in perilous waters once the battle was over. After all, she does as she pleases and owed Tycoon nothing.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_56_ORIGINAL;First Worlds of Origin:[~][f2]FINAL FANTASY[/f] : As the Dragon King[~][f2]FINAL FANTASY III[/f] : As the eidolon[~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_56_1;[#ff368c79]A Series Regular[/#][~]The classic of classics, Bahamut has had a place in the FINAL FANTASY universe since the very beginning. “King of Dragons,” “The First Sire,” “Hallowed Father to all Eidolons”—let’s just say he’s managed to collect a lot of imposing names over the years.[~][~]And it’s no wonder players keep welcoming him back with open arms. He’s a dragon. With wings. And he breathes fire—fire so hot that it’s [f2]mega [/f]fire. Plus people keep giving him cool prefixes and suffixes like “Neo” and “Zero.” No eidolon has ever had it so good.[~][~]Naturally, with a flashy history like that, the Grymoirian Bahamut also had to be dialed up to eleven.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_56_2;[#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] One of the Pleiad / Anger management issues / Visits Nine Wood Hills to find Lann and Reynn[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_56_3;[#ff368c79]Tiababylo[/#][~]You might think the name comes from “Tiamat” and “Babylon” or something like that, but we can assure you, it’s utter nonsense. Probably. Anyway...[~][~]Bahamut hails from the world of dragon kings, a fearsome place inhabited only by those with near-divine power. Most of these dragon kings have rather short tempers, so you can imagine what happens when you put them together in the same room. It’s a constant free-for-all where the weak are meat and only the strong survive.[~][~]Sixteen of them proved themselves to possess power far greater than the rest. Among these sixteen were Tiababylo, one of Grymoire’s Pleiad, and Brandelis, the future Exnine Knight.[~][~]Tiababylo was enraged to learn Brandelis had begun calling himself “king of Bahamut” even though the struggle for dominance in their homeworld was nowhere near finished. Tiababylo did not know that in another world, his rival had bound himself to man and cyborg and become an Exnine Knight. Their petty struggle was no longer Brandelis’s concern.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_57_1;[#ff368c79]A Series Regular[/#][~]Odin is another classic character who has turned up in virtually every FINAL FANTASY with a summoning system. His trademark Zantetsuken can slice through anything, and he always appears with his beloved horse, Sleipnir. A mounted swordsman who can demolish any enemy with a single blow—awesome, right? No wonder he’s popular. And he gets the celebrity treatment, too, playing a vital story role in more than one title.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_58_1;[#ff368c79]A Series Regular[/#][~]Among the members of the Pleiad, Diabolos is the most recent newcomer to FINAL FANTASY. Still, that genie-in-a-bottle trick was memorable enough to land him a spot beside the legends. Don’t be surprised if he pops up in more games.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_58_2;[#ff368c79]Notes:[/#] One of the Pleiad / Devilish good looks? / Master of dreams and fantasy / Decidedly icky personality[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_58_3;"[#ff368c79]A Wily Adversary[/#][~]Diabolos slips between the cracks of fantasy and reality to invade your dreams—seeing your greatest fears and your darkest desires, altering your memories, and destroying you from the inside out. His methods are sly, cunning...hard to spot until it’s too late. He’s one adversary that no one wants to face.[~][~]The towns targeted by Diabolos during the Pleiad’s reign of terror were the most chilling to behold in the aftermath
CHARACTER_JITEN_58_4;[#ff368c79]Night Hungers[/#][~]What motivates this terror of terrors to cause so much hurt? Well, the diabolos in Grymoire strengthen their own dreamworlds by dominating the dreams of others, feeding off of their victims in order to grow and thrive. Some of the diabolos nurture happy thoughts and quiet dreams, simply sampling them and leaving the dreamers intact. Others, however, delight in the taste of nightmares—they’re apparently delicious—and work to fill their victims’ thoughts with horrors before robbing them of their dreams and their sanity.[~][~]When Diabolos was still one of the Dyad’s Servants, Reynn and Lann did their best to cure him of his malevolent tastes. With a little encouragement (okay, mostly hard discipline), Diabolos managed to become slightly less nasty than he once was. Still, he reverted to his original dark tactics with Shelke, and it fell on the twins to once again step forward and give him a stern slap on the wrist.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_59_2;[#ff368c79]A Series Regular[/#][~]Having first floated onto the scene in FINAL FANTASY’s early days and stayed in fans’ hearts since, the adamantoise is the very meaning of longevity. He’s huge and he’s tough, and it’s hard to forget a monster like that.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_59_3;[#ff368c79]Hard Workers[/#][~]Most Grymoirian adamantoises are quite meek and mellow when compared to those found in other worlds. This makes them a regular target of bullying, and the situation that Lann and Reynn found the minimantoise in was unfortunately not an isolated incident.[~][~]When a little minimantoise finally transfigs into the massive adamantoise, they gain significant strength. But big and strong though they are, their gentle nature gives them an inherent disadvantage in the dangerous waters of the Low Seas. Sadly, not many survive for very long.[~][~]Addy, the adamantoise the twins met, has managed to fend off these dangers long enough to grow to a truly gargantuan size. This he must use, day and night, to defend those he cares about from the Low Seas’ many threats.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_60_2;[#ff368c79]The Quacho Ruby[/#][~]A strange enchantment lies on the tears of the Quacho Queen, causing each one shed to crystallize into the fabulously rare and fabulously valuable quacho ruby. Each is said to be worth over 100,000,000 gil.[~][~]Because of the fantastic wealth attainable by making the Quacho Queen cry, mages, treasure hunters, and other seekers of fortune have infiltrated the Sunken Temple and caused Her Quajesty undue amounts of pain and discomfort. Most of them were men, and the tortures visited upon her at their hands have caused her to come down with an acute case of androphobia. Now, the very sight of a guy puts her into a tizzy.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_60_3;[#ff368c79]Queen of the Quachos[/#][~]The Quacho Queen is, as evidenced by her name, the undisputed ruler of the quachos. In their community, only the most worthy quacho may transfig into royalty.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_60_4;[#ff368c79]Lann, the Special Case[/#][~]Although the queen has a fear of men, she’s more than strong enough to defend the Sunken Temple from nearly any comer. (That tonberry king was the exception rather than the rule.) Even while sobbing in panic and terror, she has nevertheless sent man after man packing with a Quacho Queen-sized footprint on his back.[~][~]Thus, when Lann (and Reynn) defeated her, she found herself inexplicably drawn to Lann’s courageous (?) and noble (?) form. To sum it up, this little queen is smitten. However, her romantic experience level is currently at -1. Unable to understand the strange sensations boiling in that quacho heart of hers, she descends into a confused fluster whenever Lann walks through the door—which makes her rather human...in a manner of speaking.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_61_2;[#ff368c79]Look Familiar?[/#][~]If you think you’ve seen these guys before, you probably have! They’re based on a chatty penguin named Pavlov from [f2]FINAL FANTASY CRYSTAL CHRONICLES: My Life as a King[/f]. Pavlov was quite a character, and his species has found new life in Grymoire as the noble quachos.[~][~]One day, the quachos may produce their own weird little talking bird named Pavlov—and won’t [f2]that [/f]be something.[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_61_3;[#ff368c79]A Dapper Duo[/#][~]Miney and Mo serve as the Quacho Queen’s attendants, and you can always find them by her side. Although they may look the same, they are their own quachos. That one’s Miney, this is Mo. Got it?[~][~]If you listen closely, you’ll notice that Miney and Mo have their own, distinctive voices. If you can’t tell them apart by sight (how rude!) then maybe sound will do the trick.[~][~]Anyway, when the time comes for a regime change, you can bet that a standout quacho like these two will take the queen’s place.[~][~]

In short: what a handful.[~][~]Still, goblins can be a reasonable bunch, and it seems that deep down, their princess has a good heart. Perhaps that’s why the Federation was able to take advantage of her and her kin.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_63_2;[#ff368c79]A Series Regular[/#][~]Ultros first showed up as a kind of one-shot story character, and wasn’t part of the main FINAL FANTASY lineup. However, he’s been making a comeback in recent years—with full voice![~][~]Ultros’s name comes from Orthros, a two-headed dog in Greek mythology. There’s no explaining the mental leap from a dog to a weird purple octopus monster, but one thing’s for certain: his name [f2]comes [/f]from Orthros, but it definitely isn’t Orthros. (Guess the memo hasn’t reached everyone yet. Sorry, so sorry!)[~][~]
CHARACTER_JITEN_63_3;[#ff368c79]Unanimously Hideous[/#][~]Terra’s a purehearted girl who always looks for the best in everyone, but even she had to agree with prevailing opinion on Ultros: he really is too hideous to be true.[~][~]

What if he’s [f2]not [/f]coming back, but multiplying instead? No no no, that’s...too frightening of a prospect to even consider.[~][~]If Ultros hadn’t shown up in Tometown and ruined everything, we might have gotten to see Celes and Cloud take the opera stage together. I’m sure some people hate Ultros all the more now for spoiling that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.[~][~]

CHARACTER_JITEN_65_2;[#ff368c79]Shiva on Wheels[/#][~]“Ixion” is her name, and “shiva” is her tribe.
