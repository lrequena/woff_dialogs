sub25_080_0000;Your life is mine!
sub25_080_0001;Hmm? What now? My heart...[~]The anger that held it has given way to something far worse...
sub25_080_0002;That’s Uncle Takka—what he would feel.
sub25_080_0003;My uncle would never hurt anyone, not even a fly.[~]And he never tried to take revenge for my aunt.
sub25_080_0004;No matter how much you hate someone, when you lash out...[~]it just leaves you empty. He always said so.
sub25_080_0005;Empty...[~]So this is how it feels to be human...
sub25_080_0006;Watch out! If it’s like Tama,[~]we have to assume this thing has got nine lives!
sub25_080_0007;Well, how many does it have left?!
sub25_080_0008;No wonder the thing wouldn’t die,[~]no matter how many times I killed it.
sub25_080_0009;Huh?!
sub25_080_0010;So be it!
sub25_080_0011;(GRUNT/GASP as he is no longer able to stand)
sub25_080_0012;Whoa! Did you see that?
sub25_080_0013;Lann! These shiny things must contain the black fox’s lives!
sub25_080_0014;Dude, nice!
sub25_080_0015;So...it seems this body...[~]and with it, my soul...must expire.
sub25_080_0016;It's down to two lives—that’s all you left it with.[~]You must’ve...had a grueling fight.
sub25_080_0017;And yet I have nothing to show for my great struggle.[~]Nothing at all...
sub25_080_0018;......
sub25_080_0019;And now, it seems...[~]my time to leave this world has come...
sub25_080_0020;If I may ask you...one favor.[~]See this man is buried alongside his...beloved wife...
sub25_080_0021;......
sub25_080_0022;Okay... I will.
sub25_080_0023;Uncle...
sub25_080_0024;Did Refia leave already?
sub25_080_0025;Yeah. They’re going to hold a proper funeral in Saronia.
sub25_080_0026;Gotcha.
sub25_080_0027;Well, Refia’s a strong girl.[~]She’s gonna be all right.
sub25_080_0028;Anyway! I suppose I should head over there and make myself useful.
sub25_080_0029;You going on all fours?
sub25_080_0030;Like I told you, it’s very simple—
sub25_080_0031;Cats get around?
sub25_080_0032;You know it.
sub25_080_0033;So! Who wants to go back to Nine Wood Hills[~]and bring that girl the kyubi lives we got like the bad mom bombs we are?
sub25_080_0034;Sounds good.
