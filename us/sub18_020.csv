sub18_020_0001;What?! That was the most powerful Mirage I’ve ever seen![~]And you’re telling me [f2]more[/f] of ’em will turn up here?!
sub18_020_0002;Who knows, kiddo. But, if it’ll win me points with the world’s loveliest ladies,[~]then I say go ahead and keep churning these nightmare adversaries out.
sub18_020_0003;Uhh... I say “please don’t.”
sub18_020_0004;Vivi! Don’t chicken out.[~]You want to be single forever?
sub18_020_0005;......
sub18_020_0006;Whatever that Mirage was,[~]I don’t think it came here just to attack without rhyme or reason.
sub18_020_0007;It wouldn’t bother going out to sea except to do reconnaissance.
sub18_020_0008;Well, whoever it’s testing the waters for,[~]I’m ready to guard the world’s treasures.[~]...By which I mean women.
