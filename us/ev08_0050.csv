ev08_0050_0000;Don’t the-give up![~]If we kick the bucket inside a threshold,[~]we’re all but the-done for!
ev08_0050_0001;But they’re...they’re too strong!
ev08_0050_0002;Grrr...
ev08_0050_0003;I have you now. Hide Refia all you want,[~]but you can’t play hide-and-seek with destiny.[~]Fate has chosen us!
ev08_0050_0004;The thane of Saronia?[~]Why is he here?
ev08_0050_0005;Guh!
ev08_0050_0006;He [f2]followed[/f] us here?!
ev08_0050_0007;RrraaaAAARRRGH!
ev08_0050_0008;Wh...what the...
ev08_0050_0009;Aaaaaah!
ev08_0050_0010;Out of the hydra, and into the crack-the-pot![~]What are we gonna the-do?
ev08_0050_0011;Doesn’t this make you just want to kiss kismet?[~]These divine designs... Isn’t fate great?[~]Now that it’s brought us together, anything could happen.
ev08_0050_0012;Just imagine. Are we destined for something bigger?[~]Or could it be...our cookies are merely meant to crumble?
ev08_0050_0013;Now, Jiants from the Hills. These questions...[~]are all yours and mine to answer!
ev08_0050_0014;Nngh...
ev08_0050_0015;Rrgh...
ev08_0050_0016;You scoundrel![~]Find another ship to spew your bilge on!
ev08_0050_0018;Graaahhh!
ev08_0050_0019;So this is how...the dice have rolled...
ev08_0050_0020;Wow!
ev08_0050_0021;Hey. Clowns.
ev08_0050_0022;Huh?
ev08_0050_0023;Y-yes, ma’am!
ev08_0050_0024;Perhaps you’d care to explain.
ev08_0050_0025;So, the Federation replaced Thane Takka[~]with one of their soldiers?
ev08_0050_0026;Actually, we’re not too sure about that ourselves.
ev08_0050_0027;But everything we’ve told you is true.
ev08_0050_0028;Honest to the-goodness!
ev08_0050_0029;Well, believe me, I’d not put anything[~]past those Federation dogs,
ev08_0050_0030;but if they have monsters like [f2]that[/f] in power...
ev08_0050_0031;Hey, um...
ev08_0050_0032;Hm?
ev08_0050_0033;Captain Faris, you wouldn’t happen to know[~]where they’re headquartered?[~]The Federation, I mean.
ev08_0050_0034;Bahamut’s citadel?[~]No one knows a lick about that, lass.
ev08_0050_0035;It was worth a shot...
ev08_0050_0036;Why? Was that your reason for trying to steal my ship?[~]To go off on some wild goose chase?
ev08_0050_0038;Uhh... The whole idea was Lann’s!
ev08_0050_0039;You don’t say.
ev08_0050_0040;What? Me? Oh, I would never ever—I mean I don’t even [f2]like[/f] ships,[~]not that there’s anything wrong with your— Oh, please don’t hurt me.
ev08_0050_0042;Ha ha. Belay there, lad.
ev08_0050_0042_1;Okay?
ev08_0050_0043;You see...
ev08_0050_0044;I might be able to help you gents on your way after all.
ev08_0050_0045;If you [f2]are[/f] the Jiants from the Hills—[~]the ones the prophecy mentions—
ev08_0050_0046;then I recall the same prophecy[~]mentioning where you’re supposed to go.
ev08_0050_0047;Huh? You mean there’s more to it?
ev08_0050_0048;Ahoy, Mog! You’ve read the prophecy, haven’t you?
ev08_0050_0049;Aye, I have, kupo!
ev08_0050_0050;The prophecy says quite clearly[~]that the Jiants from the Hills will collect four keys,
ev08_0050_0051;open up a pathway to the Crystal Tower,[~]brave its dangers, and mount the very heavens, kupo!
ev08_0050_0052;Four keys, huh?
ev08_0050_0053;Wait, the Crystal Tower?
ev08_0050_0054;Hmm... So Mog, I don’t suppose you know[~]where the four keys might be?
ev08_0050_0055;I’m afraid I know of only the first one, kupo.
ev08_0050_0056;That’s one more than I do!
ev08_0050_0057;Kupo! The first key is said to lie in a...[~]Oh, ’twas a valley of fire, kupo!
ev08_0050_0058;Where’s that?
ev08_0050_0059;I can think of one place. The fire valleys in Babil,[~]down to the south of the Low Seas.
ev08_0050_0060;Ugh, there’s those Low Seas again.
ev08_0050_0061;What labor, all these twists and little turns.[~]But fate must be allowed to run its course...
ev08_0050_0062;Hee hee hee hee hee!
