ev11_0030_0000;So Rydia, what’s the difference between a summoner like you and a Mirage Keeper?
ev11_0030_0001;You know, I should be asking you the same thing.
ev11_0030_0002;In most cases, summoners can only maintain a bond with one or two Mirages at the most.
ev11_0030_0003;To be called a Mirage Keeper you have to be special.
ev11_0030_0004;Keepers can exercise power over a countless number of Mirages.
ev11_0030_0005;How is it you create a bond with so many of them?
ev11_0030_0006;Huh? Well...I guess I’ve never really thought about it that much.
ev11_0030_0007;Tama, can you answer that?
ev11_0030_0008;Hwah? Hmm... Good the-question. I never the-really thought about it as some kind of the-bond before.
ev11_0030_0009;Huh? Then Tama’s not your familiar?
ev11_0030_0010;Familiar?
ev11_0030_0011;Yes. Mine is this dragon here.
ev11_0030_0012;The first Mirage a summoner connects with stays by the summoner’s side to give her protection.
ev11_0030_0013;They’re sort of like guardians.
ev11_0030_0014;Oh, I’m under no the-obligation to protect Lann and Reynn. It’s the-optional!
ev11_0030_0015;Gee thanks.
ev11_0030_0016;Hmm, I guess that “keeping” Mirages and “summoning” Mirages must be two pretty distinct things.
ev11_0030_0017;As far as I can tell, there must be a big difference indeed.
