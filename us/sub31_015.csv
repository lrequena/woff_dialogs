sub31_015_0000;What now?[~]Where am I? What is this?
sub31_015_0001;It’s a fantasy. “Where dreams and reality and time all touch”...[~]But don’t ask me to explain what that means exactly.
sub31_015_0002;I guess you might say, when somebody fights our friends, we tag in![~]Ya get it?
sub31_015_0003;But how can...[~]Ohhh! You two! How many long years have passed?
sub31_015_0004;Can’t tell you that, but,[~]did we really use to know each other?
sub31_015_0005;Forget all that. Faris thinks you killed her great-grandpa and Syldra’s family.[~]Is that really true?
sub31_015_0006;Well, honestly, I’m not altogether certain myself.
sub31_015_0007;As I recall...when Tycoon’s crew was attacked by Bismarck’s forces,[~]on a whim, I may have helped them to defend themselves.
sub31_015_0008;Once I left, any number of villains could have done them in.[~]But that’s no concern of mine.
sub31_015_0009;Then you mean, Faris and Syldra are mistaken?
sub31_015_0010;So, why not just tell them as much?
sub31_015_0011;If their hatred for me has been festering all this time,[~]then I cannot calm the waves by telling them[~]it was all a big misunderstanding.
sub31_015_0012;As such, the wisest course of action is to accept their challenge.[~]To...let them break themselves against me.
sub31_015_0013;The way you’re making it sound—you know they’re fighting over nothing,[~]but you still won’t let them win? Really?
sub31_015_0014;Why would I let them win?[~]I am not beholden to them. They chose this.
sub31_015_0015;Then I’ve got bad news.
sub31_015_0016;To fight them, you have to go through us.
sub31_015_0017;Well that...can be easily arranged!
