SaloniaOutskirts_npc_03_A;All I want is to be able to live my own life. Is it so wrong for me to seek my own path, and not strive to become an Architect?
SaloniaOutskirts_npc_03_B;Now what are they doing to us? Well, whatever it is, I don’t care. There’s no way I’ll ever be an Architect!
SaloniaOutskirts_npc_03_C_01;Finally, the time has come when anyone can pursue their dreams! Nothing’s going to stand in my way now. My life is truly my own.
SaloniaOutskirts_npc_03_C_02;Huh? You want to know what my dream is? Why, that’s easy. To live happily ever after, of course!
