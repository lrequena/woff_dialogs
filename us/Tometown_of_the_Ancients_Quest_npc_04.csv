Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_04_A_01;I live for frights and terrors... You’re Mirage Keepers, right?
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_04_A_02;I hear that some Mirages are actually ghostly apparitions haunting the earth.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_04_A_03;Can you bring me one of these delightful terrors?
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_04_B_01;I knew you wouldn’t let me down.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_04_B_02;Bring me a ghostly Mirage... I’m so looking forward to it.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_04_C;Hmph. Fine then. I’ll just have to search myself.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_04_D;Hm? You’ve changed your mind?
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_04_E;The scarier the better. I’ll be waiting.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_04_F_01;Ahh! Th-that scared me! I never knew Mirages that terrifying existed.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_Quest_npc_04_F_02;This is for you... Take it. I had a great time. See you around... Heh ha ha!
