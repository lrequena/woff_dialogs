sub49_010_0000;Dun-dun-da-dun! You the-get a ★star! Applause!
sub49_010_0001;Uh, what are you talking about?
sub49_010_0002;Whenever you the-successfully unlock all of a Mirage’s abilities, I get to certify that Mirage as a Master Mirage...
sub49_010_0003;and commemorate it by the-giving you a ★star.
sub49_010_0004;Uh, okay. Thank you.
sub49_010_0005;You’re going to want to thank me even the-more in a sec!
sub49_010_0006;Once a Mirage gets its ★star, I can the-award it a stat bonus or a bonus ability! The-neat, huh?
sub49_010_0007;Maybe you’ve already the-noticed?
sub49_010_0008;Aw, now that’s what I call service!
sub49_010_0009;Wow, we’d better create as many Master Mirages as we can. Look at all the upsides!
sub49_010_0010;Oh, hey, Tama! Give me a ★star too!
sub49_010_0011;Uhh... Sorry Lann, but I’m afraid you just aren’t the-what I’d call “master” material.
sub49_010_0012;I know, can you imagine? “Master” Lann? Aha ha ha, aha ha ha ha ha!
sub49_010_0013;That’s the silliest thing I’ve ever the-heard. “Master” Lann? Hee hee hee, aha ha ha ha ha!
sub49_010_0014;Hey, what’s so funny?! I could [f2]totally[/f] be “Master” Lann... Ha ha, aha ha ha ha! “Master” Lann... Aha ha ha ha!
sub49_010_0015;I’m starting to wonder if I’ve put Grymoire in the right hands. But, for now I’ll just laugh along. Ha ha ha ha!
