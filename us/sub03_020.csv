sub03_020_0000;Hey, what are these arma gem things?
sub03_020_0001;Hm? You’ve found some arma gems?
sub03_020_0002;We’re not exactly sure what they’re for,[~]but we did turn up a few.
sub03_020_0003;That’s good. They have great value here.[~]You can think of those gems as a kind of token.
sub03_020_0004;Token?
sub03_020_0005;Yes. In order to touch another’s soul, or to tamper with time,[~]first, you must offer compensation.
sub03_020_0006;Hence the arma gems—tokens you can pay in recompense.
sub03_020_0007;Ohhh! So the more we find,[~]the more stuff we can do here.
sub03_020_0008;...Right.
sub03_020_0009;[f2]But isn’t that kind of dodging the question?[~]Okay, they’re tokens, but where do they come from?[/f]
sub03_020_0010;You needn’t wonder about every little thing.
sub03_020_0011;Huh?!
sub03_020_0012;The world has some secrets[~]you’re simply better off not knowing.
sub03_020_0013;Oh-kay...
