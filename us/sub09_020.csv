sub09_020_0000;Get ready.
sub09_020_0001;Yeah! Just lemme at ’em!
sub09_020_0002;Bring it on, kupo!
sub09_020_0003;Over there.
sub09_020_0004;Hmm, I can’t see my own needles.
sub09_020_0005;We’re gonna get lost, kupo!
sub09_020_0006;Next.
sub09_020_0007;Right! All aboard now!
sub09_020_0008;I can do this all day, kupo!
sub09_020_0009;Well, friends? Can you keep going?
sub09_020_0010;Ugh! I can’t move my arms![~]Wait, that’s normal.
sub09_020_0011;I'm...so...[~]pumped up, kupo!
sub09_030_0000;You know, is it just me,[~]or are these Mirages running away from something?
sub09_030_0001;So they’re not just acting up, kupo?
sub09_030_0002;Hmm, you’re right. I get the distinct impression[~]that we’re getting in [f2]their[/f] way more than vice-a versa.
