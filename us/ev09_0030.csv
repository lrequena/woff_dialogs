ev09_0030_0000;Ready to go?
ev09_0030_0001;Okay, right this way.
ev09_0030_0002;Godspeed, gents.
ev09_0030_0003;Thanks! Oh, right...
ev09_0030_0004;Where’s my manners? Sorry we tried to rob you!
ev09_0030_0005;We really didn’t mean to cause you trouble.
ev09_0030_0006;You can make it up to me. Perhaps...
ev09_0030_0007;If you survive. Farewell!
ev09_0030_0008;Huh?!
ev09_0030_0009;Come on! This way.
ev09_0030_0009_1;Wait, where does [f2]that[/f] road go?
ev09_0030_0009_2;It’s the way back to town. I mean, isn’t that how you got here?
ev09_0030_0009_3;The other road is crawling with Mirages. Nobody uses that one anymore.
ev09_0030_0009_4;Dude! Oh, I so wish we knew about that coming in.
ev09_0030_0009_5;Well, that figures. I [f2]thought[/f] something about these docks smelled fishy.
ev09_0030_0009_6;But at least we found some good the-Mirages! No worries, the-right?
ev09_0030_0009_7;Yeah! No worries at all! *whimper*
ev09_0030_0010;Here she is.
ev09_0030_0011;Just gimme a sec.
ev09_0030_0012;I set the helm to autopilot,[~]so it’ll take you right to the Low Seas.
ev09_0030_0013;Now get going, before the thane[~]or the rest of the Federation catch on.
ev09_0030_0014;Wow, you’re just as nice as a peach.
ev09_0030_0015;Thank you for everything!
ev09_0030_0016;Bye now! Don’t come back and haunt me!
ev09_0030_0017;Huh?
ev09_0030_0018;What?!
ev09_0030_0041;Ohhh wooow...
ev09_0030_0042;Note to self: the Low Seas are not south.
ev09_0030_0043;What the honking HAWWWNK!
ev09_0030_0044;They are literally straight DOOOWN!
ev09_0030_0045;Aaah! Gravity, NOOOOOO!
ev09_0030_0046;Ah, AAAAAAGH!
ev09_0030_0047;Ha ha ha! Aha ha ha! The-ha ha!
ev09_0030_0048;Daaagh!
ev09_0030_0049;Gaaah!
ev09_0030_0050;Agh, jelly sandwich!
ev09_0030_0051;H-how are we alive?
ev09_0030_0052;Tama, you still with us?
ev09_0030_0053;Never been the-betterer...
ev09_0030_0054;Hey! Don’t do that on my head!
ev09_0030_0000_1;Board the ship?
ev09_0030_0000_2;Yes
ev09_0030_0000_3;No
