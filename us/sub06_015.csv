sub06_015_0000;Grrraaah!
sub06_015_0001;Raaah!
sub06_015_0002;Heh heh heh...
sub06_015_0003;I thought we did this already...
sub06_015_0004;Hey guys, why isn’t Ramuh here with you?
sub06_015_0005;Whoa, hey![~]Don’t go saying Ramuh’s name out loud like that!
sub06_015_0006;Seriously! The old man is all eyes and ears![~]What kind of hot water are you twerps trying to get us in?
sub06_015_0007;And you! What were you thinking saying “Ramuh”?![~]Oops...
sub06_015_0008;I heard that, you two.
sub06_015_0009;Tell me, why would you sneak away?[~]What possessed you?!
sub06_015_0010;Oh, uh, well, you know...[~]We were, uh, sort of bored out of our wits...
sub06_015_0011;No, look![~]We were giving Lann and Reynn some help with their training!
sub06_015_0012;Oh! Nice. That is right.[~]We’re [f2]only [/f]thinking of them.
sub06_015_0013;You numbskulls.[~]There’s a reason we must stay in the Nebula, and you know what it is.
sub06_015_0014;Ugh, we’re not [f2]dumb[/f]. The tri-elemence barrier, right?[~]We have to maintain it.
sub06_015_0015;Come on. It’s just one excursion.
sub06_015_0016;Dunderheads! Already your little “excursion”[~]has led to two casualties!
sub06_015_0017;What?! Don’t tell me someone got out?
sub06_015_0018;Do you know who it is that escaped?
sub06_015_0019;An ifrit and a shiva.[~]In both cases, you might say they were your unfairer sex.
sub06_015_0020;Ugh, great. It just had to be her.
sub06_015_0021;He’s on the loose?! Ugh.[~]This is going to be such a pain in the duff.
sub06_015_0022;Hey, you said “casualties.”[~]You don’t mean people?
sub06_015_0023;Yeah, they’d have to be. When no one summons us,[~]we have to enter this world the old-fashioned way.
sub06_015_0024;It’s simple, really. In lieu of an elaborate summoning ritual,[~]we can just use the magic in a human body as our gate.
sub06_015_0025;And as for the poor human...[~]Well, it's kind of messy.
sub06_015_0026;What?!
sub06_015_0027;The Nether Nebula—boundaries there are thin.[~]Therefore, the old queen came to us and asked we place a barrier there,[~]along the world’s fringe.
sub06_015_0028;And because [f2]these[/f] two decided to goof off...
sub06_015_0029;Now, people have been hurt.
sub06_015_0030;Uh, um...
sub06_015_0031;Uh... Look, we made a big mistake.
sub06_015_0032;A colossal mistake, you clods!
sub06_015_0033;Ugh... So to sum it up, another ifrit and shiva[~]are on the loose and wreaking havoc here in Grymoire, right?
sub06_015_0034;Mmm. They may have been waiting for just this chance—[~]if they know [f2]our[/f] Ifrit and Shiva and how responsible they always are.
sub06_015_0035;Well, they’re just two Mirages. Me and Reynn can handle ’em.[~]We’ll find ’em and teach ’em a good lesson!
sub06_015_0036;That’s right. You three return to the Nebula.[~]Take care of that barrier.
sub06_015_0037;Very well. In that case, we will leave images of ourselves here in this place,[~]so you may continue to train with us as before.
sub06_015_0038;Unless you object?
sub06_015_0039;Uh...no! You took the words right out of my maw.
sub06_015_0040;Mmkay. Lann, Reynn, see you!
sub06_015_0041;Great goblins.[~]They certainly are a handful.
sub06_015_0042;A female ifrit and a male shiva, right?
sub06_015_0043;And just when we thought we’d run out of Mirages to collect.
