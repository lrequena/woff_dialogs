sub40_010_0000;Whew! Between the Cogna and Mirages,[~]I could really use a break.
sub40_010_0001;Can’t wait till this is over[~]and I can get back to blitzball training!
sub40_010_0002;Hmph. I’ve got my own business to attend to.[~]As long as he’s still out there...
sub40_010_0003;As for me, I know that once Bahamut is dealt with and the Cogna are gone,[~]I’ve always dreamed of becoming an instructor.
sub40_010_0004;......!
sub40_010_0005;Squall? You okay there, buddy?[~]Don’t think I’ve ever seen you like this. You look kinda troubled.
sub40_010_0006;So you...you’ve all given some thought to what happens next.[~]You’ve got aspirations, and you all know where you’re going.
sub40_010_0007;But not...me.
sub40_010_0008;Nothing? Come on, you must’ve put [f2]something[/f] on hold for this.[~]What were you gonna do with your life?
sub40_010_0009;I mean, once all the bad guys are gone for good,[~]what’s the first thing you wanna do?
sub40_010_0010;Like, there can’t be [f2]nothing![/f]
sub40_010_0011;You wanna know what I’m planning to do with my life?[~]...I never thought about it. I guess I [f2]have[/f] no future...
sub40_010_0012;Hey, there’s nothing wrong with being undemanding!
sub40_010_0013;[f2]Is Tidus right? ...No, it’s worse than that.[~]It’s like I’m empty. I’ve got no dreams...[~]I don’t think I even [/f]know[f2] how to dream.[/f]
sub40_010_0014;[f2]All I really know is...fighting.[~]Is that what my life is?[/f]
sub40_010_0015;[f2]Once the Federation has been destroyed,[~]will I no longer have a purpose?[/f]
sub40_010_0016;Squall! We’ve picked up a powerful Mirage.[~]Shelke is already en route. Can you go?
sub40_010_0017;Sure, I’ll take care of it.
sub40_010_0018;Besides, it’s not like I’ve got anything else important on the horizon...
sub40_010_0019;I’m here now. I’ll take over.
sub40_010_0020;Hold on a minute. Let’s team up—it’ll improve our chances.[~]If we attack both its—
sub40_010_0021;Just stay back. I said I’ve got it!
sub40_010_0022;Huh?
sub40_010_0023;Guh!
sub40_010_0024;Would you let me finish this time?[~]If we work togeth—
sub40_010_0025;Just stop. Fighting—it’s the only thing I’ve got.[~]I’m not like the rest of you.
sub40_010_0026;You’ve got bright futures. I won’t let you get hurt...[~]Leave that to losers like me.
sub40_010_0027;Hm? Ugh...
sub40_010_0028;Then put your fears to rest.[~]I’m like you. I have nothing to live for beyond this.
sub40_010_0029;I am ready to die in battle,[~]whenever that moment should come.
sub40_010_0030;What? But, still...
sub40_010_0031;Please. You just said that fighting is all you’ve got.[~]If so, you must know exactly how I feel.
sub40_010_0032;I have no dreams. As such, I’ve no incentive to survive this war.[~]In fact, I have a very compelling incentive to [f2]not[/f] survive.
sub40_010_0033;So why don’t we do this?[~]Let’s go out guns blazing. End it all here and now.
sub40_010_0034;Discharging all our magic at once would destroy that Mirage.
sub40_010_0035;[f2]Yeah... Right.[~]If I really thought that the world would be better off without me...[/f]
sub40_010_0036;[f2]If I’m that sad, that desperate...[~]Fine.[/f]
sub40_010_0037;But I [f2]don’t[/f] think that.[~]Not enough to give up on living. No way.
sub40_010_0038;Hm?
sub40_010_0039;No guns blazing. I [f2]do[/f] have a dream.[~]Sorry. No dying today.
sub40_010_0040;You know what I dream?
sub40_010_0041;That one day...[~]I’ll fill the world with flowers.
sub40_010_0042;...Huh?
sub40_010_0043;Think about it. Flowers make people relax.[~]Way I see it, they help make the world more peaceful.
sub40_010_0044;When this is over, I was hoping you would come and plant with me.[~]So...don’t go dying on me now.
sub40_010_0045;If you don’t have your own dream, you can find one later.[~]All right? Life is just too precious.
sub40_010_0046;Glad you’re catching on. Now quit your moping,[~]stop dragging yourself in the dirt, and work with me.
sub40_010_0047;Wha...?! Shelke![~]Did you...play me?
sub40_010_0048;Well, after your talk with Tidus,[~]I noticed you seemed somewhat down.
sub40_010_0049;Heh. You got me. Won’t do it again.[~]So, you ready? Future’s waiting.
