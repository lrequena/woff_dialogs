npc_awin_0000_0000;I’m going to need time to learn to trust you like I used to. But bit by bit...we’ll see.
npc_awin_0000_0001;When the time comes, just let me know.
npc_awin_0000_0002;Reverse-summoning...
npc_awin_0000_0003;How’s it going?
npc_awin_0000_0004;Is there anything I can help you with?
npc_awin_0001_0000;Have you been to Grymoire’s Nine Wood Hills yet?
npc_awin_0001_0001;I doubt that you two remember this,
npc_awin_0001_0002;but when we all lived there, there were still lots of Jiants who called it their home.
npc_awin_0001_0003;You know...many were our friends...
npc_awin_0002_0000;I had a chance to speak with that woman you told me about, Sherlotta.
npc_awin_0002_0001;She said that up until a few decades ago, there were many Jiants living in these lands. But then one day, it seems they started to disappear, one by one.
npc_awin_0002_0002;There’s no evidence they were wiped out by the Bahamutian Army. Which makes you wonder what did happen to them...
npc_awin_0003_0000;Only direct descendants of the Farna family have the power to become what we call Mirage Keepers. That includes Lady Lusse, and the two of you.
npc_awin_0003_0001;On the other hand, summoners are quite different. We can be born into any family.
npc_awin_0003_0002;Although I too have a summoner’s power within me, I was always really bad at it. It was only after Lady Lusse gave me a special dagger, like the one Reynn has,
npc_awin_0003_0003;that I finally managed to form a connection with a Mirage.
npc_awin_0004_0000;Your familiar is Siren, right, Wyn?
npc_awin_0004_0001;Yes. She was my very first summon, thanks to the dagger.
npc_awin_0004_0002;Then...who was the Mirage with that illusion in the mask?
npc_awin_0004_0003;That was Carbuncle. You see, he was the second Mirage that I bonded with...
npc_awin_0004_0004;But they took Carbuncle away from me. His soul is theirs now.
npc_awin_0004_0005;How? The Exnine Knights can do that?
npc_awin_0004_0006;With enough magic, anything can be turned into a portal...
