ev22_0100_0000;No! Is it done yet?!
ev22_0100_0001;Almost... Just a little more time!
ev22_0100_0002;Really? Is that all?
ev22_0100_0003;Rrraaah!
ev22_0100_0004;Huh? Reynn?
ev22_0100_0005;Concentrate![~]Focus on the cage so it only encases him!
ev22_0100_0006;Right!
ev22_0100_0007;Folly!
ev22_0100_0008;Come ON!
ev22_0100_0009;We’re not going to make it!
ev22_0100_0010;Lady Lusse...[~]Help us!
ev22_0100_0011;A cage within a cage! Focus![~]Imagine nesting many cages together!
ev22_0100_0012;Dad?
ev22_0100_0013;Reynn, you need to be the strong one.[~]Don’t let Lann’s power overtake him. Keep control.
ev22_0100_0014;Mom?
ev22_0100_0015;You’ll be okay.[~]If you work together, there’s no happiness you can’t attain.
ev22_0100_0016;Reynn. You ready?
ev22_0100_0017;Yeah.
ev22_0100_0018;Such power...[~]It’s not possible...
ev22_0100_0018_1;......!
ev22_0100_0018_2;(BREAKING through the crystal)
ev22_0100_0019;Aaah!
ev22_0100_0020;Hrrrah!
ev22_0100_0020_1;......?
ev22_0100_0021;Oof!
ev22_0100_0022;Haaa!
ev22_0100_0023;Guh!
ev22_0100_0023_1;Aaah!
ev22_0100_0024;Tama!
ev22_0100_0024_1;Hup!
ev22_0100_0025;Ah...!
ev22_0100_0026;I’ll kill you yet!
ev22_0100_0027;Can it!
ev22_0100_0028;Huh?! Reynn? Lann?!
ev22_0100_0029;There! Use those to keep Grymoire safe!
ev22_0100_0030;You’ll find all the other prismariums with Serafie!
ev22_0100_0031;Huh? Wh-what are you saying?
ev22_0100_0032;The Dyad has done enough damage.[~]It’s time for us to leave for good.
ev22_0100_0033;You can’t! I don’t—
ev22_0100_0034;Everything’s going to be better, Wyn.[~]Once we go through, the portal will vanish,
ev22_0100_0035;so these trash cans won’t ever be able[~]to meddle in your world again.
ev22_0100_0036;But...what about you?
ev22_0100_0037;Hey! Get those corners turned up.
ev22_0100_0038;You don’t want your happiness spilling out.
ev22_0100_0038_1;......!
ev22_0100_0039;Tama! Take care of Wyn and Grymoire for us once we’re gone!
ev22_0100_0040;And thank you for everything!
ev22_0100_0040_1;......
ev22_0100_0041;Here...goes!
ev22_0100_0041_1;Ah!
ev22_0100_0042;Oh, and Wyn! All of you![~]Sorry we put you through so much grief! Good-bye!
ev22_0100_0043;Good-bye! Take care!
ev22_0100_0044;We’ll see you around!
ev22_0100_0044_1;You’ll pay for this...!
ev22_0100_0045;They brought us so much bad and good.[~]And then they just swept it all away in the end.
ev22_0100_0046;I’ll say. The two of them were a force of nature.
ev22_0100_0047;Maybe I’ll take a leaf out of their playbook[~]and go a little crazy for a change!
ev22_0100_0048;Oh, please. Your current crazy levels are hard enough on us.[~]Well, at least Reynn and Lann seem like they’re gonna be okay.
ev22_0100_0049;Yes. If they stay together,[~]we have nothing to worry about.
ev22_0100_0050;Okay, it’s our turn.[~]Grymoire's gonna need some fixing up.
ev22_0100_0051;It’s gonna be a lot of work.
ev22_0100_0052;Well... See ya.
ev22_0100_0053;Thanks, you two.[~]You can rest now.
ev22_0100_0054;Well done.
ev22_0100_0055;Oh! I nearly forgot.[~]You both have a reward coming.
ev22_0100_0055_1;(gently BLOWING)
ev22_0100_0055_2;(HEARING something falling)
ev22_0100_0056;Don’t you hate when you say all your good-byes[~]and then find out you’re not leaving? It’s the worst.
ev22_0100_0057;Aw, let’s just roll with it.[~]One thing about Grymoire...it never gets old for me.
