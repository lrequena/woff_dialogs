ev00_0060_0000;“Mirage Keepers”? Me and Reynn?
ev00_0060_0001;That’s the-correct!
ev00_0060_0002;Those the-marks on your arms are proof.[~]You were born to work the-miracles!
ev00_0060_0003;Miracles?
ev00_0060_0004;Our arms can...do that?
ev00_0060_0005;Dude...
ev00_0060_0006;How could you the-forget? You used to command a whole[~]the-legion of them. You were [f2]masters[/f] of them:[~]powerful, living illusions known as “Mirages”!
ev00_0060_0007;In the-fact, even the Pleiad answered to you,[~]and those are the seven strongest Mirages of all![~]With their power, you could have the-ruled over all the world!
ev00_0060_0008;Oh...
ev00_0060_0009;So...we could have ruled the world?[~]Because, what, we controlled these “Mirages”?
ev00_0060_0010;Well, that’s what I the-heard.
ev00_0060_0011;From who?
ev00_0060_0012;What do you mean? Enna Kros the-told me, of course!
ev00_0060_0013;But enough the-reminiscing.[~]I’ve gotta the-teach you two to use Mirages again.
ev00_0060_0014;What? How’s that?
ev00_0060_0015;First off, I’m the-going to present you{NewLine}with my very own prismarium!
