ev21_0036_0000;Okay, I’ll take you down in the airship.
ev21_0036_0001;If you need to get back up here—
ev21_0036_0002;Oh, don’t worry about that. We can always use the Gates.
ev21_0036_0003;That’s the-right! My Gates let you cheese it halfway across the-Grymoire in a blink! They're like the ultimate the-shortcut!
ev21_0036_0004;Really? Sounds like I’ll have to look into them.
ev21_0036_0005;Hey! Let’s call the Gates “Cheesecutters”!
ev21_0036_0006;What?! Don’t talk about my poor the-Gates like they’re something that comes out of your rear the-end! Boo hoo...
ev21_0036_0007;Lann! Don’t you know a baby moogle dies whenever you tell a joke like that? Boo hoo hoo...
ev21_0036_0008;Dude! What joke? Did I say something wrong?
