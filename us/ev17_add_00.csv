ev17_add_00_0000;Hey, know what they call a locomotive with vampire fangs?
ev17_add_00_0001;I sense a bad the-joke coming...
ev17_add_00_0002;Honestly, I’m more impressed he knows the word “locomotive.”
ev17_add_00_0003;A “chew-chew” train. Because it’s got fangs. Fangs that chew.
ev17_add_00_0004;I...think I need a pillow to cry in.
ev17_add_00_0005;There’s just no hope for us any-the-more.
