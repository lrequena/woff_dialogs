ev21_0085_0000;What’s this?
ev21_0085_0001;Wait, Lann, what do you think you’re—[~]Aaah!
ev21_0085_0002;Huh? Reynn?! She vanished!
ev21_0085_0003;Oh the-no![~]What are we the-going to do?!
ev21_0085_0004;I-I don't know! Don’t the-look at me!
ev21_0085_0005;Huh? I think she’s the-calling me.
ev21_0085_0006;Aaah! No, Tama, not you the-too!
ev21_0085_0007;Okay... What now? What do I do?[~]I’ve the-lost them both!
ev21_0085_0008;I won’t tell him if you won’t.
ev21_0085_0009;Hey, no objections the-here.
ev21_0085_0010;Ha ha... Oh, you guys. I [f2]knew[/f] you were okay.[~]I mean, we’ve seen plenty of contraptions like this.
ev21_0085_0011;Uh-huh.[~]Don’t pretend like you weren’t freaked out.
ev21_0085_0012;With these devices,[~]it shouldn’t take us anywhere near as long to make it to the top.
ev21_0085_0013;But from now on, don’t touch [f2]anything[/f] without checking with me first.[~]You got that?
ev21_0085_0014;Yuuup, [f2]got[/f] it.
ev21_0085_0015;What did I just say?!
ev21_0085_0016;Laaann....
ev21_0085_0017;Laaann...
ev21_0085_0018;Oops! Heh... I’ll be good.
