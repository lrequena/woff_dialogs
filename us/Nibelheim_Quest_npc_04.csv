Nibelheim_Quest_npc_04_A_01;My dance moves just don’t have that certain something anymore... What is it that I’m missing?
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_04_A_02;Oh, you’re Mirage Keepers, aren’t you? Your timing is perfect!
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_04_A_03;I’ve heard that some Mirages out there are real lookers!
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_04_A_04;If you find any Mirages like that, could you show them to me? I need some new inspiration!
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_04_B_01;You will?! Oh, thank you so much! I just know this is going to be a huge help to me!
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_04_B_02;She’s got to be graceful... And cute...and...on second thought, never mind. Any female Mirage should do the trick!
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_04_C;I see... No, I understand. Sorry to bother you.
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_04_D;Oh, hello again... I don’t suppose...you’ve changed your mind, have you?
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_04_E;She’s got to be graceful and cute! Oh, don’t worry, I trust your judgment.
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_04_F_01;She’s so graceful and cute! That’s it! Now I know exactly what it is I’ve been missing!
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_04_F_02;And it’s all thanks to you! Oh, you’re the greatest!
Nibelheim_Quest_npc_04_F_03;This is for you. No need to be shy! Well, see you around!
