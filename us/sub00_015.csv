sub00_015_0000;That face![~]“Aww, I hate walking everywhere.”[~]I can read you like a book!
sub00_015_0001;Huh? Me?
sub00_015_0002;Yeah. I know a lazy slacker when I see one.
sub00_015_0003;Hey!
sub00_015_0004;What’s up?
sub00_015_0005;Oh, just some news you may find of interest.
sub00_015_0006;Heh heh heh. It’ll blow your little minds. Why?[~]Because...you will never believe this...
sub00_015_0006_02;Yeah...?
sub00_015_0006_03;Huh?
sub00_015_0007;All throughout Nine Wood Hills,[~]I have staked out some windways!
sub00_015_0008;Windways?
sub00_015_0009;Steak! Now that you mention it, I’m starving![~]Have you got anything else tasty on the menu?
sub00_015_0010;Oh, sure. Here you are.[~]Might I recommend today’s special, the sahagin soup...
sub00_015_0011;Stop that![~]We’ll never get to the point if you egg him on like that!
sub00_015_0012;Huh? You want eggs?
sub00_015_0013;Oh! Fried? Sunny-side up?!
sub00_015_0014;Hmm... All we’ve got is scrambled.
sub00_015_0015;Just tell us about the windways!
sub00_015_0016;Oh, those?[~]They’re basically just shortcuts.
sub00_015_0017;The kids call it “fast-travel.”[~]You get to zip around every which way using one of those GUI doohickeys. Yup.
sub00_015_0018;Uh, I don’t think you’re allowed to go there.
sub00_015_0019;So what if the food’s a little gooey![~]I’ll still eat it!
sub00_015_0020;We are not talking about food!
sub00_015_0021;Ohhh, wait, I get it![~]All that business about steak—that was a pun! Nice one, Lann.
sub00_015_0022;Oh. Thank you!
sub00_015_0023;Don’t tell me you thought he was serious!
sub00_015_0024;Heh heh, heh heh heh!
sub00_015_0025;Heh heh, heh heh heh!
sub00_015_0026;I’ve realized something just the-now.[~]We can never the-leave Lann and Serafie alone together.
sub00_015_0027;Nothing good could come of it...
sub00_015_0028;But! If you always take the easy way, you’ll wind up as flabby as a flan...so get in some walking time too, now and then, or you’ll be sorry.
