sub35_010_0000;Is this the place?[~]That Mirage menace has gotta be close now.
sub35_010_0001;Oh! Wasting no time, I see.[~]You’re going down! Hrrraaah!
sub35_010_0002;Aaah!
sub35_010_0003;What the?!
sub35_010_0004;Wha—! You lunatic!
sub35_010_0005;Sorry! I thought you were a Mirage.
sub35_010_0006;Last I heard, there was a real dangerous one prowling the area.
sub35_010_0007;You’re the only danger here.[~]Do you always lunge at strangers without thinking?
sub35_010_0008;I said I’m sorry![~]So! Let’s roll. Uh, where you headed?
sub35_010_0009;Hm? You say that as though you actually believe[~]I’ll let you come along with me.
sub35_010_0010;Well, of course I am.[~]A dangerous Mirage is on the loose in this forest.
sub35_010_0011;It’s not safe to be wandering around by yourself!
sub35_010_0012;What a hero. You know, I’m perfectly capable of handl—
sub35_010_0013;So! It’s settled![~]I’m Snow. And you?
sub35_010_0014;...Celes. You know, it’s rude to in—
sub35_010_0015;Celes, huh! I like it![~]Okay, off we go!
sub35_010_0016;...terrupt.
sub35_010_0017;So tell me about this Mirage.
sub35_010_0018;Well, according to the villagers,[~]the thing’s supposed to be some kind of colossal beast.[~]Somebody’s got to step up and do something about it.
sub35_010_0019;And you let them talk you into hunting it? Ugh...
sub35_010_0020;BAAAAAARTZ! Show yourself!
sub35_010_0021;What was that?!
sub35_010_0022;I have you now! Bartz! ...Huh?
sub35_010_0023;What have we here. So [f2]you’re[/f] the Mirage everyone’s talking about.[~]Oh yeah. You look like trouble to me.
sub35_010_0024;Am I seeing things? Bartz? Is that you?[~]Something’s different about you, is it the hair?
sub35_010_0025;Well, you’re done scaring the villagers![~]I’m putting you down right now!
sub35_010_0026;Nice try! You’ll need more than an extreme makeover[~]to pull the wool over Gilgamesh’s eyes!
sub35_010_0027;Oh, I see.[~]I’ll bet it was you that set that vicious monster on me before!
sub35_010_0028;Any last words?!
sub35_010_0029;Listen to you.[~]It’s like you’re having separate conversations!
sub35_010_0030;Hey! Gilgamesh, right?[~]Do you think that monster that attacked you could have been the...
sub35_010_0031;I have awaited this day a hundred years![~]It’s over, Bartz!
sub35_010_0032;Your reign of terror...is over!
sub35_010_0033;This is insane.
