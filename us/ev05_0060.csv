ev05_0060_0000;The way you use Mirages...[~]Only Lusse Farna ever held such power over them.
ev05_0060_0001;Tell me. Who [f2]are[/f] you?
ev05_0060_0002;Huh? “Lusse Farna,” you said?[~]But that’s our...mother.
ev05_0060_0003;Hey, you’re right![~]That [f2]was[/f] her name!
ev05_0060_0004;Uh, listen, you wouldn’t happen[~]to know this “Lusse Farna”?
ev05_0060_0005;Let me show you something.
ev05_0060_0006;Huh?
ev05_0060_0007;That’s the earring—the same one Mom used to wear.
ev05_0060_0008;[f2]Right. I[/f] knew [f2]I recognized it.[~]The ornament on Yuna’s staff.[/f]
ev05_0060_0009;What? Then, it’s her?
ev05_0060_0010;Roughly one hundred years ago,[~]a Champion from another world saved Grymoire.[~]Her name was Lusse Farna.
ev05_0060_0011;Huh? Mom did that?[~]But, a hundred years...
ev05_0060_0012;It doesn’t make sense. Mom’s a Champion?[~]And this is some kind of monument to her?
ev05_0060_0013;NOT USED
ev05_0060_0014;So, you keep saying that Lady Lusse was your mother.[~]Again, may I ask who you are?
ev05_0060_0015;Well, uh...
ev05_0060_0016;No memory?[~]That [f2]is[/f] strange.
ev05_0060_0017;Do you think you might be able to tell us[~]a little more about Lady Lusse?[~]We’d appreciate anything at all.
ev05_0060_0018;I’m sorry, I only know the common legends.[~]The ones Grymoire’s people have grown up with.
ev05_0060_0019;Fine. We’ll take anything.
ev05_0060_0020;Sometime around a century ago, the world of Grymoire[~]was nearly destroyed by a being that has come to be known[~]as the Demon Dyad.
ev05_0060_0021;Lusse Farna prevented this by creating the Ultima Gate—
ev05_0060_0021_1;a bridge to salvation from which she summoned three Heralds,[~]straight from the realm of the gods.
ev05_0060_0021_2;Thus, she became Grymoire’s Champion.

ev05_0060_0024;NOT USED
ev05_0060_0025;That definitely sounds like something out of mythology.
ev05_0060_0026;Bridging the gap between worlds[~]is a serious the-accomplishment.[~]She must have been the-mazing!
ev05_0060_0027;That she was.[~]But sadly, even though she managed[~]to save the world from the Demon Dyad...
ev05_0060_0028;Huh?
ev05_0060_0029;The Heralds... All three of them[~]chose to remain here in Grymoire.[~]And one of them is now Brandelis, king of Bahamut.
ev05_0060_0030;NOT USED
ev05_0060_0031;Huh? But Bahamut...[~]That’s the federation that attacked Cornelia!
ev05_0060_0032;Yes. After they finished “saving” the world,[~]Brandelis and the others[~]harnessed a legion of new Mirages,
ev05_0060_0033;and slowly took control of Grymoire’s lands,[~]building a powerful federation.
ev05_0060_0034;“Legion of new Mirages”...[~]Lann, you don’t think there’s any connection[~]to the ones we lost...do you?
ev05_0060_0035;What? That’s not possible.[~]We’re talking about a hundred years ago.
ev05_0060_0036;But where have we been? Nine Wood Hills,[~]which Enna Kros told us was a world without time.[~]Right, Tama?
ev05_0060_0037;Right the-you are. Compared to other the-worlds,[~]the concept of time [f2]there[/f] is, let’s say...[~]more than a little bit the-unusual.
ev05_0060_0038;So, if you want to know just the-how long you were there,[~]there’s really the-no way to measure!
ev05_0060_0039;Dude, what?
ev05_0060_0040;Umm... If you don’t mind my asking,[~]what ever happened to Lady Lusse?[~]After the Heralds came?
ev05_0060_0041;Unfortunately, we don’t know for sure.
ev05_0060_0042;Some say summoning the Heralds[~]was an act that cost her her life.
ev05_0060_0043;While others say she lives as a prisoner[~]in the Heralds’ castle, her freedom lost forever.
ev05_0060_0044;Prisoner?
ev05_0060_0045;What?! Well, then where can we find this castle?!
ev05_0060_0046;I wish I could help,[~]but I don’t [f2]know[/f] where to find it.
ev05_0060_0047;Not just me. No one. Not even the soldiers in their army.[~]They say Brandelis keeps its whereabouts a secret.
ev05_0060_0048;Huh? How do you hide a big honking castle?!
ev05_0060_0049;Hey, take it easy!
ev05_0060_0050;Come on, it’s a legend.[~]Are you really gonna get all worked up[~]over something carved on a rock?
ev05_0060_0051;They share the same name.[~]That doesn’t automatically have[~]to mean they’re the same person.
ev05_0060_0052;Well...yeah, maybe not.[~]But you can’t try and tell me this is just a coincidence.
ev05_0060_0053;Would you listen?
ev05_0060_0054;[f2]All this stuff we’re “remembering,” like Mom’s name?[~]What if it turns out none of it is true?[/f]
ev05_0060_0055;[f2]But I guess there’s no point in telling Lann that.[/f]
ev05_0060_0056;What is it already?
ev05_0060_0057;Oh, just forget it.
ev05_0060_0058;If it’s Bahamut that you’re after, you should start[~]in one of the Federation’s member states,[~]and do your asking around there.
ev05_0060_0059;Saronia lies further north.[~]I believe they just joined the Federation.
ev05_0060_0060;NOT USED
ev05_0060_0061;What?
ev05_0060_0062;Dude, what?[~]But I thought Saronia[~]was the place we’re going to!
ev05_0060_0063;Then Princess Sarah must not have known...
ev05_0060_0064;Ugh... Oh well.[~]We’ve already made it this far.
ev05_0060_0065;NOT USED
ev05_0060_0066;Yeah. We wouldn’t be very good emissaries[~]if we turned back now. And we did promise[~]to ask about the League of S.
ev05_0060_0067;I’m real sorry I raised my voice at you.[~]I know you were trying to help us out, so thanks.
ev05_0060_0068;No, I should be sorry for attacking you.[~]It was wrong to accuse you of[~]being something you’re clearly not.
