Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_08_A_01;Oh, so you made it through unscathed?
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_08_A_02;Not long after all the trouble started going down, this person with a ghastly, pale face attacked me—
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_08_A_03;I thought I was a total goner.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_08_A_04;But then this toootal dreamboat with this huuuge sword came along and rescued me.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_08_A_05;I wish I could thank him somehow, but I have no idea where he went afterwards.
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_08_B;One of those machines attacked me outside of town. But then this toootal dreamboat with a scar on his face came out of nowhere and saved my hide!
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_08_C_01;I don’t even know who’s the dreamiest anymore. The hunk with the big sword? The one with the scar on his face?
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_08_C_02;Or Celes, for keeping this town safe all the time!
Tometown_of_the_Ancients_npc_08_C_03;...Yes, I know Celes is a woman. The bigger question is, is she single?
