SaloniaPortTown_npc_01_A_01;I used to think that the Federation were a pretty scary lot, but look at how much they’re doing for us.
SaloniaPortTown_npc_01_A_02;All you have to do is work towards becoming an Architect, and they’ll give you everything you need to get by.
SaloniaPortTown_npc_01_A_03;It’s great! Now I wish we’d gone and joined them ages ago!

SaloniaPortTown_npc_01_D_01;You should’ve seen the commotion around here when we heard the Federation fell apart.
SaloniaPortTown_npc_01_D_02;It’s a little nerve-racking to not have anyone watching out for us anymore. But I think we’ll be fine as long as we stick together.
