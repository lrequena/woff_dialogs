ev21_0140_0007;Release Lady Lusse!
ev21_0140_0008;How long must this continue, Pellinore?
ev21_0140_0009;Huh?
ev21_0140_0010;(TAKING A HEAVY HIT)
ev21_0140_0011;A hundred years and counting now, and yet commanding just one body[~]proves a chore? How lowly and pathetic can you get?
ev21_0140_0012;My body...gives me more trouble...than yours does.
ev21_0140_0013;Oh, but I do wonder about that.
ev21_0140_0014;Hey, scumbags![~]We’ve been lookin’ for you!
ev21_0140_0015;If you think you can just wreck the world and get away with it,[~]then you have got another thing coming!

ev21_0140_0017;Wyn, are you—[~]Uh, Hauyn. You okay?
ev21_0140_0018;So you’ve made it this far...[~]But, no more.
ev21_0140_0019;You have to stop. You mustn’t fight![~]I know you want to...but you simply can’t.
ev21_0140_0020;What drivel! What tripe! A farce beyond compare!
ev21_0140_0021;Are you quite certain of that?[~]What if they are the world’s true Champions awakened at last?
ev21_0140_0022;Should we not deal with them now?
ev21_0140_0023;And now it’s you who’s causing me to grin.[~]The Crimson Prophecy’s a done affair.[~]The story needs no postscript, no twist, and no spin.
ev21_0140_0024;Exeunt... Begone, you whelps!
