ev18_0050_0000;Well, it sounds like every-the-one’s heard about the temple we’re after.
ev18_0050_0001;Thing is, none of these people have actually been there.
ev18_0050_0002;What’d you expect? It’s the “temple in the deep.” You think people would call it that if it was swimmable?
ev18_0050_0003;And from the look of it, the train probably doesn’t stop there either.

ev18_0050_0004;“Pantaloggist... Always Here to Assist”?
ev18_0050_0005;Wow. A person that studies the-pants? They think of the-everything!
ev18_0050_0006;Yeah. Pants must be serious business.
ev18_0050_0007;It’s “pantologist,” dummy. The prefix is “pan.”
ev18_0050_0008;Cookware, huh? Neat!
ev18_0050_0009;Not [f2]those[/f] pans. As in “all”! Like they do a little of everything.
ev18_0050_0010;Ohhh! Well, if they do a little of everything, then maybe they can do a little of helping us get down to that sunken temple.
ev18_0050_0011;Let’s hit the pants!
ev18_0050_0012;Wha— Wait! Lann!
ev18_0050_0013;NOT USED
