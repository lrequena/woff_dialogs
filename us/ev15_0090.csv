ev15_0090_0000;Midgar seems to be down[~]for a nice, long sleep.
ev15_0090_0001;Midgar?
ev15_0090_0002;Ah. That’s what the place is called—[~]the underground facility you explored.
ev15_0090_0003;Huh? Why did you guys name your prison?
ev15_0090_0004;Well, it’s not, technically speaking, a prison at all.
ev15_0090_0005;Huh?
ev15_0090_0006;No? Then what?
ev15_0090_0007;A kingdom this size?[~]We’d never fill so large a prison.
ev15_0090_0008;The men you met down there—[~]those were my guards in disguise.
ev15_0090_0009;Dude...
ev15_0090_0010;I [f2]thought[/f] the guy’s prices[~]were a little too good to be true.
ev15_0090_0011;If I might explain:[~]Figaro’s submerging castle has always been in my family.
ev15_0090_0012;But I was the one who discovered the facility—[~]ten years ago, while trying to figure out how the castle ticked.
ev15_0090_0013;Excited, I enlisted Shinra’s help.[~]We investigated...
ev15_0090_0014;and discovered that the facility was called “Midgar”[~]and powered by special energy known as “mako.”
ev15_0090_0015;However, not only was it teeming with Mirages,
ev15_0090_0016;The machines that Shinra was using for the investigation—[~]they developed a mind of their own and attacked us.
ev15_0090_0017;There were too many threats down there,[~]not to mention it housed my moving castle’s power source.
ev15_0090_0018;And so, of course, I needed a good cover story[~]that would keep even the Federation away.
