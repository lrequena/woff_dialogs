sub25_090_0000;Huh? Where is the kyubi?[~]Were you only able to acquire its souls?
sub25_090_0001;Huh? Oh no. Did we botch up the job?
sub25_090_0002;Hmm... It’s a little unorthodox.[~]But, this could work.
sub25_090_0003;What do you mean?
sub25_090_0004;Since you brought two, we’ll use one to spin a new thread,
sub25_090_0005;and give Tama the other[~]so that she’ll have a life to spare when the time comes.
sub25_090_0006;Cool! Whatever that means, let’s do it!
sub25_090_0007;Okay, I’ll do my best to keep the changes to a minimum.[~]You don’t have to stay here and watch.
sub25_090_0008;Um, are you sure?
sub25_090_0009;It’s a lot to explain, not to mention the long ritual.[~]And since time is going to change, you won’t remember anyway...
sub25_090_0010;Hellooo, Reynn?[~]Anybody home in there?
sub25_090_0011;Huh?
sub25_090_0012;Maybe she’s so tired of your antics she finally the-flatlined.[~]Look at the-what you’ve reduced her to.
sub25_090_0013;Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.[~]I have never anticked once in my entire life.
sub25_090_0014;You don’t even the-know what the word antics—
sub25_090_0014_1;Tama!
sub25_090_0015;Hwah?! R-Reynn, the-what’s the matter?
sub25_090_0016;Huh? What? I...I was...just really happy to see you is all...[~]That’s weird.
sub25_090_0017;Oh-the-kay...
sub25_090_0018;Zzz... Don’t make me fill in for that lazy Tama anymore please... Zzz...
sub25_090_0019;You’re a good friend.
