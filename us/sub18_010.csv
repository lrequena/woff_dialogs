sub18_010_0000;I need a word, Edgar.
sub18_010_0001;Well, what have we here.[~]If it isn’t the Venus of the Sea.
sub18_010_0002;Belay that nonsense before I dry heave myself to death.
sub18_010_0003;Ahaha, forgive me.[~]I was just so overcome by your beauty...
sub18_010_0004;Enough! Now tell me, what have you dredged up about that Cogna?
sub18_010_0005;Please, please. I find your courage intriguing,[~]but I’d just as soon not have you stick out that beautiful neck of yours.
sub18_010_0006;That thing has damaged my ship and injured my crew.[~]I would have seen to it myself if it hadn’t fled inland.
sub18_010_0007;From what we’ve seen, it strikes at random by land, sea, and sky—[~]and worse, it can adapt its shape to each locale.
sub18_010_0008;We have to hit it where we can:[~]on solid ground [f2]and[/f] out on the water.
sub18_010_0009;But, now that it’s made an enemy of Figaro,[~]I can assure you it won’t get anywhere near your ship again.
sub18_010_0010;Please, leave the creature’s disposal to us.
sub18_010_0011;How heroic. That monstrosity should rightly die by my own hands,[~]but do the deed if you’re so willing.
sub18_010_0012;Yes. I only ask that if I return home safely, you reward me—
sub18_010_0013;[f2]Aye![/f] Now that that’s settled, I’ll be on my way.[~]And if that thing does best you,[~]you have my word that you’ll be properly avenged.
sub18_010_0014;Where are we?
sub18_010_0015;We call this site the Eye of the Desert.[~]It’s where Figaro Castle originally stood.
sub18_010_0016;It’s in places like this and Big Bridge that you might,[~]if you’re especially lucky, see Mirages that no one else has.
sub18_010_0017;You mean like brand-new ones?
sub18_010_0018;Right. They appear in no legend or book—[~]not even in Tometown’s treasure trove of volumes.
sub18_010_0019;What’s more, some have said[~]that the Eye of the Desert could be connected to other worlds.
sub18_010_0020;What does it mean when worlds are connected?[~]Something happens?
sub18_010_0021;Well, it means... Heh.[~]I knew it would just be a matter of time before it found its way back.
sub18_010_0022;Vivi, look out!
sub18_010_0023;Ah—ah—aaah!
sub18_010_0024;I hate being right!
