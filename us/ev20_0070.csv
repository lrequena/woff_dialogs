ev20_0070_0000;Hey there, Hauyn.
ev20_0070_0001;Tell me one thing.[~]Your past—do you remember any of it?
ev20_0070_0002;No... Not really.
ev20_0070_0003;’Fraid not.
ev20_0070_0004;Right. Of course.[~]If you did remember, there’s no way you would be talking to me.
ev20_0070_0005;But, I do remember you’re my sister, Wyn.
ev20_0070_0006;She does. But I don’t.
ev20_0070_0007;So then. What will you do to me [f2]this [/f]time?
ev20_0070_0008;Do to you?[~]But Wyn, those knights were holding you prisoner.
ev20_0070_0009;Stop.
ev20_0070_0010;Huh?
ev20_0070_0011;I don’t know you anymore, so don’t call me that.
ev20_0070_0012;But Wyn—
ev20_0070_0013;Enough.
ev20_0070_0014;Oh...kay.
ev20_0070_0015;I was a prisoner for a very long time.[~]But it wasn’t the knights.
ev20_0070_0016;Well, who then?
ev20_0070_0017;You ought to know.
ev20_0070_0018;And why should I bother to help you figure out the obvious.[~][f2]You[/f] have to remember.
ev20_0070_0019;For Lady Lusse.
ev20_0070_0020;Our mom?[~]Is she here? Is she still alive?
ev20_0070_0021;Yes. They’re here.[~]Lady Lusse, [f2]and [/f]Lord Rorrik.
ev20_0070_0022;Rorrik? Our dad?![~]Then Mom and Dad are both okay? Where are they?
ev20_0070_0023;But you know that, too.[~]Where they are. What they’re doing.
ev20_0070_0024;We do? Are you sure?
ev20_0070_0025;Hauyn...are you one of the bad guys?
ev20_0070_0026;Me? One of them?[~]You must be joking!
ev20_0070_0027;But, you went around in a mask tricking us!
ev20_0070_0028;Enough. Say no more.[~]I just don’t want to hear it.
ev20_0070_0029;......!
ev20_0070_0030;......!
ev20_0070_0031;Siren!
ev20_0070_0032;Kreeeeee!
ev20_0070_0033;Wait! You can’t go![~]We still have so many questions!
ev20_0070_0034;You bring nothing to this world but pain and chaos!
ev20_0070_0035;Leave now! Go back home, and never wake from your sleep again!
ev20_0070_0036;Your mother and father...[~][f2]I’ll [/f]save them.
ev20_0070_0037;Gosh-bomb it...[~]What the honk is her problem? She didn’t tell us [f2]anything![/f]
ev20_0070_0038;No...but you heard what she said about Mom and Dad.[~]They need to be saved.
ev20_0070_0039;Huh? Oh, yeah. I guess she did.[~]Okay, but what do they need saving [f2]from?[/f]
ev20_0070_0040;I don’t know.
ev20_0070_0041;Hey! What’s going on? Did you see that Mirage?[~]...Where’s Hauyn?
ev20_0070_0042;That explains what happened.[~]But then, what are you two going to do now?
ev20_0070_0043;I’m not sure.
ev20_0070_0044;I know this may sound a little selfish, but...
ev20_0070_0045;if you don’t mind, maybe you could help us fight off[~]the Cogna that’ve appeared across Grymoire.
ev20_0070_0046;We need more manpower.[~]As much as we can get.
ev20_0070_0047;Sure.
ev20_0070_0048;Huh?
ev20_0070_0049;Whether we were tricked or not,[~]we’re still the ones who brought them here.
ev20_0070_0050;We have to fix this.[~]As long as we have the power to do it.
ev20_0070_0051;Yeah, you’re right. Besides...
ev20_0070_0052;......?
ev20_0070_0053;Helping the League out with operations[~]means gathering Mirages and getting stronger.
ev20_0070_0054;If Serafie and Tama are right,[~]and we can trust what Enna Kros told us,
ev20_0070_0055;then we ought to keep going.[~]Let’s collect Mirages, and find our family.
ev20_0070_0056;Yeah.
ev20_0070_0057;Great. Okay then, the airship—we’ll let you borrow it.
ev20_0070_0058;The skies are yours![~]Go on out there and help wherever you can!
