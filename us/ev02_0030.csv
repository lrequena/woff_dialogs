ev02_0030_0005;Whoa, pluck my needles! I don’t know [f2]how[/f] long[~]it’s been since we’ve had new passengers.
ev02_0030_0006;Right. Tickets, please!
ev02_0030_0007;Aaah!
ev02_0030_0008;Ohhh!
ev02_0030_0009;A Mirage?
ev02_0030_0010;What? It talks?!
ev02_0030_0011;Oh, I indeedily needily [f2]am[/f] a Mirage,[~]but I’m also the train conductor, sooo...[~]tickets, please!
ev02_0030_0012;The conductor? Well, all right...[~]If Tama can talk, then why not?
ev02_0030_0013;But, the train tickets that we need—
ev02_0030_0014;Are right the-here!
ev02_0030_0015;Right the-[f2]how?[/f]
ev02_0030_0016;Wow! Semi-lifetime passes, eh?[~]Haven’t feasted my eyes on one of these in a swell spell.
ev02_0030_0017;Right, then. Pleasant journey!
ev02_0030_0018;Where did those tickets come from?
ev02_0030_0019;Enna Kros made sure I was provided with everything[~]we could ever the-need. Yup-the-yup!
ev02_0030_0020;So why a “semi”-lifetime pass?[~]And not a lifetime one?
ev02_0030_0021;Oh. Hey Sis, let’s park it here.
ev02_0030_0022;Sure.
ev02_0030_0023;They’re so tiny.
ev02_0030_0024;Uh, okay then...
