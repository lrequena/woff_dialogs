sub35_020_0000;D’owww, ow ow ow ow!
sub35_020_0001;That’s what happens to Mirages that misbehave![~]The villagers want you gone, so tough luck!
sub35_020_0002;Huh? Sorry? Villagers?
sub35_020_0003;Juuust STOP! Listen, Snow!
sub35_020_0004;Huh?! What are you doing?![~]Don’t tell me you’re on his side!
sub35_020_0005;Would you just settle down?! Listen when people talk to you![~]Hey, buffoon!
sub35_020_0006;Who, me?
sub35_020_0007;Earlier you mentioned that some vicious monster attacked you, right?
sub35_020_0008;What did the thing look like?
sub35_020_0009;Um... I suppose that I would describe it as a colossal beast.[~]But it met a quick end at the hands of Gilgamesh and his mighty blade!
sub35_020_0010;Snow, do you see now? That dangerous Mirage is gone.[~]And you, Gilgamesh...
sub35_020_0011;This isn’t the person you’ve been looking for.[~]His name’s Snow. Not Bartz.
sub35_020_0012;W-well, when you point it out...[~]he [f2]seems[/f] dangerous, but doesn’t look especially beast-like.
sub35_020_0013;Whoooa! So Bartz is someone else?![~]I just knew that something was off!
sub35_020_0014;Awww, that was my bad, Gargle-musher![~]Man! You totally had me fooled there.
sub35_020_0015;Ha ha ha! I like your style![~]You may not be Bartz, but you’re just as worthy an opponent!
sub35_020_0016;I had the wrong guy, but you put up a good fight![~]I like your style!
sub35_020_0017;Do they even hear each other?
sub35_020_0018;Any tough guy willing to go a round with me—[~]hey, we are now [f2]bros[/f].
sub35_020_0019;Bros, you say? Bros...[~]I like the sound of that!
sub35_020_0020;Maaan, the two of us must have been [f2]destined[/f] to go head-to-head today.[~]Do you think we, like, knew each other in some past life?
sub35_020_0021;Nooo... Not that I remember.
sub35_020_0022;Then, have you ever been a frog?
sub35_020_0023;Nooo... Not that I remember.
sub35_020_0024;They deserve each other.
