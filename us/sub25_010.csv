sub25_010_0000;Hey, Serafie? Sorry to bring it up again,[~]but I was hoping we could discuss Tama?
sub25_010_0001;Huh? Tama?[~]Oh, you’re talking about Tamamohimé.
sub25_010_0002;A long, loooooong time ago—[~]so far back that I can’t put a number on it—
sub25_010_0003;she and I went through some stuff,[~]after we got mixed up with a really dangerous crowd.
sub25_010_0004;You mean the Order of the Circle?[~]Tama told me about it.
sub25_010_0005;Wha?! W-well, if she dropped [f2]that[/f] name,[~]then your Tama [f2]must[/f] be the same as the one I knew.
sub25_010_0006;What the schnuzz is going on, anyway?
sub25_010_0007;Well...
sub25_010_0008;Dude, really? I do [f2]not[/f] remember that.
sub25_010_0009;Tama...did [f2]that?[/f]
sub25_010_0010;Hmm... I still don’t fully buy it, but...
sub25_010_0011;say she [f2]did[/f] sacrifice her lives. To what end?[~]It almost sounds like the Guardians of Time.
sub25_010_0012;Guardians of Time?
sub25_010_0013;Beings from the Realm of Fantasy who keep watch over this big clock,[~]and use people’s lives so as to alter the course of our history.
sub25_010_0014;Preposterous, right?[~]As credible as teeth-stealing fairies.
sub25_010_0015;A clock that intervenes in history?
sub25_010_0016;That sounds just like that girl’s tearoom.
sub25_010_0017;You’re right! So, does that make her a “Guardian of Time”?
sub25_010_0018;Huh?
sub25_010_0019;Make who?
