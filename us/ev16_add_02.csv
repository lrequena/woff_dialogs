ev16_add_02_0000;Hey, listen, Sis—
ev16_add_02_0001;You know that expression, “Cross that bridge when you come to it”?
ev16_add_02_0002;Don’t you think that’s kind of a strange turn of phrase?
ev16_add_02_0003;I mean, it’s not like you can cross a bridge [f2]before[/f] you come to it. It doesn’t make any sense.
ev16_add_02_0004;If you ask me—
ev16_add_02_0005;I didn’t, I didn’t. Please make it stop.
