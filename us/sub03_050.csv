sub03_050_0000;What’s this stuff about “invoking” Champions?
sub03_050_0001;With invocation, you can call upon the Mediums you’ve met for help,[~]and then they will fight alongside you in the field of battle.
sub03_050_0002;Dude, what? Really?
sub03_050_0003;Really.
sub03_050_0004;The catch is, you can only invoke their power for a very limited time.[~]Basically, they [f2]pop[/f] right in and [f2]fwoosh[/f] right back out.
sub03_050_0005;Pop, fwoosh. Got it.
sub03_050_0006;Mm.
sub03_050_0007;All the same, the fact that we can invoke them at all—[~]it sounds pretty useful.
sub03_050_0008;Yeah, it’ll make collecting Mirages way easier.
sub03_050_0009;All right, but there are restrictions.
sub03_050_0010;First, not all Mediums are Champions.
sub03_050_0011;They must awaken to their true potential[~]before you can invoke them.
sub03_050_0012;Furthermore, some Champions awaken in stages,[~]and each to their own abilities.
sub03_050_0013;You’ll need arma gems to awaken them,[~]and you’ll want to put some thought into who you’re going to invoke,[~]and at what time for that matter.
sub03_050_0014;Uhh... Yeah!
sub03_050_0015;And invoking isn’t free.[~]You have to bend all kinds of divine rules to pull it off,[~]which means more compensation.
sub03_050_0016;And I guess we can’t pay in arma gems?
sub03_050_0017;Not the gems. Use those here to [f2]awaken[/f] Champions.[~]To [f2]invoke[/f], you’ll have to store up a different kind of tender.
sub03_050_0018;Why don’t you think of it as a kind of gauge.[~]When you have enough Champion Points you can invoke them.
sub03_050_0019;Oh! That’s super easy to understand.[~]So, how do we go about storing Champion Points then?
sub03_050_0020;Wear down your souls.
sub03_050_0021;Huh?!
sub03_050_0022;To put it simply,[~]the gauge fills when you’re hurt, and when you defeat Mirages.
sub03_050_0023;Umm... Right! Okay.[~]So basically, all we have to do is keep fighting.
sub03_050_0024;Correct.
sub03_050_0025;......
sub03_050_0026;Oh! I won’t...overthink it.
sub03_050_0027;Oh, one thing.
sub03_050_0028;Many Champions can be found across Grymoire,[~]but you will only be able to call upon three of them at any given time.
sub03_050_0029;Think carefully about the situation,[~]and choose the Champions suited to the task at hand.
sub03_050_0030;But, why?
sub03_050_0031;It takes a lot of connecting the dots to make sure they can reach you.[~]Unfortunately, three is the most that I can handle.
sub03_050_0032;But if you’re willing to offer up your souls as additional portals,[~]then I could arrange something...
sub03_050_0033;I...am pretty sure there’s no way that can be good, so...[~]we’ll pass.
