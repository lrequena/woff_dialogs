ev22_0036_0000;Hey, Lann, do you remember the Pleiad?
ev22_0036_0001;The pleed? What’s a “pleed”?
ev22_0036_0002;I’m still a little hazy on the details myself, but...
ev22_0036_0003;remember how it seemed like Ifrit and Shiva and Ramuh seemed to recognize us?
ev22_0036_0004;I remember them mentioning something like that.
ev22_0036_0005;I think there were more Mirages like that—seven of them.
ev22_0036_0006;Oh, I get it. Is that what “pleed” means then?
ev22_0036_0007;Pleiad, but yes. So I think that might mean there are four other powerful Mirages we knew besides Ifrit, Shiva, and Ramuh.
ev22_0036_0008;Huh, no kidding. Well, considering how tough that trio is, it probably wouldn’t be a bad idea to get the rest of them on our side.
ev22_0036_0009;Yup! My thoughts exactly.
